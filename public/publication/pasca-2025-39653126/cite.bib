  abstract = {As the field of neural organoids and assembloids expands, there is an emergent need for guidance and advice on designing, conducting and reporting experiments to increase the reproducibility and utility of these models. In this Perspective, we present a framework for the experimental process that encompasses ensuring the quality and integrity of human pluripotent stem cells, characterizing and manipulating neural cells in vitro, transplantation techniques and considerations for modelling human development, evolution and disease. As with all scientific endeavours, we advocate for rigorous experimental designs tailored to explicit scientific questions as well as transparent methodologies and data sharing to provide useful knowledge for current research practices and for developing regulatory standards.},
