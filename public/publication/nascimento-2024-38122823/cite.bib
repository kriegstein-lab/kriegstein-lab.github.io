  abstract = {The temporal lobe of the human brain contains the entorhinal cortex (EC). This region of the brain is a highly interconnected integrative hub for sensory and spatial information; it also has a key role in episodic memory formation and is the main source of cortical hippocampal inputs(1-4). The human EC continues to develop during childhood(5), but neurogenesis and neuronal migration to the EC are widely considered to be complete by birth. Here we show that the human temporal lobe contains many young neurons migrating into the postnatal EC and adjacent regions, with a large tangential stream persisting until the age of around one year and radial dispersal continuing until around two to three years of age. By contrast, we found no equivalent postnatal migration in rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta). Immunostaining and single-nucleus RNA sequencing of ganglionic eminence germinal zones, the EC stream and the postnatal EC revealed that most migrating cells in the EC stream are derived from the caudal ganglionic eminence and become LAMP5(+)RELN(+) inhibitory interneurons. These late-arriving interneurons could continue to shape the processing of sensory and spatial information well into postnatal life, when children are actively interacting with their environment. The EC is one of the first regions of the brain to be affected in Alzheimer's disease, and previous work has linked cognitive decline to the loss of LAMP5(+)RELN(+) cells(6,7). Our investigation reveals that many of these cells arrive in the EC through a major postnatal migratory stream in early childhood.},
