  abstract = {Germline genetic architecture of Alzheimer's disease (AD) indicates microglial mechanisms of disease susceptibility and outcomes. However, the mechanisms that enable microglia to mediate protective responses to AD pathology remain elusive. Adgrg1 is specifically expressed in yolk-sac-derived microglia. This study reveals the role of yolk-sac-derived microglia in AD pathology, highlighting the function of ADGRG1 in modulating microglial protective responses to amyloid deposition. Utilizing both constitutive and inducible microglial Adgrg1 knockout 5xFAD models, we demonstrate that Adgrg1 deficiency leads to increased amyloid deposition, exacerbated neuropathology, and accelerated cognitive impairment. Transcriptomic analyses reveal a distinct microglial state characterized by downregulated genes associated with homeostasis, phagocytosis, and lysosomal functions. Functional assays in mouse models and human embryonic stem cells-derived microglia support that microglial ADGRG1 is required for efficient Abeta phagocytosis. Together, these results uncover a GPCR-dependent microglial response to Abeta, pointing towards potential therapeutic strategies to alleviate disease progression by enhancing microglial functional competence.},
