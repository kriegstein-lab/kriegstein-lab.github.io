  abstract = {In this issue of Cell Stem Cell, Falk and colleagues (Falk et al., 2008) demonstrate that differential responsiveness to TGF-beta signaling selectively modulates self-renewal of dorsal midbrain stem cells. This observation may lead to strategies for expanding specific neural stem cell subtypes.},
