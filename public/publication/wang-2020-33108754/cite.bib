  abstract = {During brain development, the daughter cells of neural stem cells have to make a choice - either to become new stem cells or to differentiate into neurons. In a recent issue of Science, Iwata et al. (2020) show that these fate decisions can be determined after mitosis by mitochondrial remodeling.},
