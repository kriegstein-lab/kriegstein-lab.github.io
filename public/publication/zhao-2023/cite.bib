 abstract = {Chronic neurodegeneration and acute injuries lead to neuron losses via diverse processes. We compared retinal ganglion cell (RGC) responses between chronic glaucomatous conditions and the acute injury model. Among major RGC subclasses, alphaRGCs and intrinsically photosensitive RGCs (ipRGCs) preferentially survive glaucomatous conditions, similar to findings in the retina subject to axotomy. Focusing on an alphaRGC intrinsic factor, Osteopontin (secreted phosphoprotein 1 [Spp1]), we found an ectopic neuronal expression of Osteopontin (Spp1) in other RGCs subject to glaucomatous conditions. This contrasted with the Spp1 downregulation subject to axotomy. alphaRGC-specific Spp1 elimination led to significant alphaRGC loss, diminishing their resiliency. Spp1 overexpression led to robust neuroprotection of susceptible RGC subclasses under glaucomatous conditions. In contrast, Spp1 overexpression did not significantly protect RGCs subject to axotomy. Additionally, SPP1 marked adult human RGC subsets with large somata and SPP1 expression in the aqueous humor correlated with glaucoma severity. Our study reveals Spp1's role in mediating neuronal resiliency in glaucoma.},
