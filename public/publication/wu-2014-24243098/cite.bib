  abstract = {Proper lamination of the cerebral cortex is precisely orchestrated, especially when neurons migrate from their place of birth to their final destination. The consequences of failure or delay in neuronal migration cause a wide range of disorders, such as lissencephaly, schizophrenia, autism and mental retardation. Neuronal migration is a dynamic process, which requires dynamic remodeling of the cytoskeleton. In this context microtubules and microtubule-related proteins have been suggested to play important roles in the regulation of neuronal migration. Here, we will review the dynamic aspects of neuronal migration and brain development, describe the molecular and cellular mechanisms of neuronal migration and elaborate on neuronal migration diseases.},
