Here we collected paired single-nucleus chromatin accessibility and transcriptome data from 38 human neocortical samples encompassing both the prefrontal cortex and the primary visual cortex. These samples span five main developmental stages, ranging from the first trimester to adolescence. In parallel, we performed spatial transcriptomic analysis on a subset of the samples to illustrate spatial organization and intercellular communication. This atlas enables us to catalogue cell-type-specific, age-specific and area-specific gene regulatory networks underlying neural differentiation. Moreover, combining single-cell profiling, progenitor purification and lineage-tracing experiments, we have untangled the complex lineage relationships among progenitor subtypes during the neurogenesis-to-gliogenesis transition. We identified a tripotential intermediate progenitor subtype-tripotential intermediate progenitor cells (Tri-IPCs)-that is responsible for the local production of GABAergic neurons, oligodendrocyte precursor cells and astrocytes. Notably, most glioblastoma cells resemble Tri-IPCs at the transcriptomic level, suggesting that cancer cells hijack developmental processes to enhance growth and heterogeneity. Furthermore, by integrating our atlas data with large-scale genome-wide association study data, we created a disease-risk map highlighting enriched risk associated with autism spectrum disorder in second-trimester intratelencephalic neurons.

Comprehensive cell atlases of the developing human brain, alongside those of model organisms such as mice and non-human primates, are now providing high-resolution measures of gene expression, cell-type abundance and spatial distribution. In this Perspective, we highlight recent studies that have identified novel developmental cell populations, revealed conserved and divergent patterns of cell genesis, migration and maturation across species, and begun testing hypotheses that link them to processes ranging from transcriptional control of cell fate specification to the emergence of complex behaviours. We present remaining conceptual and technical challenges and provide an outlook on how further studies of human and mammalian brain development can empower a deeper understanding of neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. Future efforts expanding to additional developmental stages, including adolescence, as well as whole-brain, multimodal and cross-species integration, will yield new insights into how development shapes the brain.

Transcriptomic analyses reveal that ADGRG1 activates the transcription factor MYC, leading to upregulation of genes involved in homeostasis, phagocytosis, and lysosomal functions, thereby promoting a protective microglial state. We demonstrate that deletion of Adgrg1 in microglia impairs MYC activation, resulting in increased amyloid-beta deposition, exacerbated neuronal loss, and cognitive deficits. Functional assays in mouse models and human embryonic stem cell-derived microglia confirm that ADGRG1 is required for Abeta phagocytosis.

Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals that nicotine exposure downregulates key genes in excitatory neurons (ENs), with CHRNA7 or CHRFAM7A selectively modulating these changes, suggesting an evolutionary divergence in regulatory pathways.

The dynamics of LAD substructure in cells that remain postmitotic for long periods of time are poorly understood. Here, we developed Genome Organization with CUT and Tag (GO-CaT) to determine the T1- and T2-LAD substructure of postmitotic excitatory neurons isolated from the prenatal and adult human cortex. While T1-LADs exhibited epigenomic features characteristic of stable, cell type-invariant LADs including strong transcriptional repression, in prenatal neurons, T2-LADs were enriched for promoter-enhancer DNA interactions, intermediate levels of gene expression, and genetic risk associated with neurodevelopmental and cognitive disorders. In adult cortical neurons, T1-LADs were expanded in size and genomic coverage, incorporating the majority of the prenatal T2-LADs, sequestering genes involved in neurodevelopment. In contrast, the minority of prenatal T2-LADs that relocated to inter-LAD regions in adult neurons were enriched for processes related to synaptic function. Overall, these data provide evidence that LADs \"mature\" in postmitotic neurons, remodeling from a genomic architecture that is more permissive for the dynamics of transcription of development to one that is more restricted and focused on the decades-long transcriptional needs of adult brain neurons.","tags":[],"title":"Substructure and maturation of lamina-associated domains in neurons of the developing and adult human brain.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mostajo-Radji MA","Leon WRM","Breevoort A","Gonzalez-Ferrer J","Schweiger HE","Lehrer J","Li Zhou, PhD","Schmitz MT","Yonatan Perez, PhD","Tanzila Mukhtar, PhD","Robbins A","Chu J","Andrews MG","Sullivan FN","Tejera D","Choy EC","Paredes MF","Teodorescu M","Arnold R Kriegstein, MD, PhD","Alvarez-Buylla A","Pollen AA"],"categories":[],"content":"PubMed ID: 40264797\n","date":1744934400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1744934400,"objectID":"d16b1612c6f2f5165f16156bc39e84b5","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/mostajo-radji-2025-40264797/","publishdate":"2025-04-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mostajo-radji-2025-40264797/","section":"publication","summary":"Neuronal subtype generation in the mammalian central nervous system is governed by competing genetic programs.

The extent to which external signals influence these identities remains unclear. Pvalb-positive INs are crucial for cortical circuit regulation but challenging to model in vitro. We grafted mouse MGE progenitors into diverse 2D and 3D co-culture systems, including mouse and human cortical, MGE, and thalamic models. Strikingly, only 3D human corticogenesis models promoted efficient, non-autonomous Pvalb differentiation, characterized by upregulation of Pvalb maturation markers, downregulation of Sst-specific markers, and the formation of perineuronal nets. Additionally, lineage-traced postmitotic Sst-positive INs upregulated Pvalb when grafted onto human cortical models.

We used computational methods to register en face somata distributions of all molecularly defined RGC types. More than 75% (34/45) of types exhibited non-uniform distributions, likely reflecting adaptations of the retina's anatomy to the animal's visual environment. By analyzing the local neighborhoods of each cell, we identified perivascular RGCs located near blood vessels. Seven RGC types are enriched in the perivascular niche, including members of intrinsically photosensitive RGC (ipRGC) and direction-selective RGC (DSGC) subclasses. Orthologous human RGC counterparts of perivascular types - Melanopsin-enriched ipRGCs and ON DSGCs - were also proximal to blood vessels, suggesting their perivascularity may be evolutionarily conserved. Following optic nerve crush in mice, the perivascular M1-ipRGCs and ON DSGCs showed preferential survival, suggesting that proximity to blood vessels may render cell-extrinsic neuroprotection to RGCs through an mTOR-independent mechanism.

These samples span five main developmental stages, ranging from the first trimester to adolescence. In parallel, we performed spatial transcriptomic analysis on a subset of the samples to illustrate spatial organization and intercellular communication.

Moreover, combining single-cell profiling, progenitor purification, and lineage-tracing experiments, we have untangled the complex lineage relationships among progenitor subtypes during the transition from neurogenesis to gliogenesis in the human neocortex. We identified a tripotential intermediate progenitor subtype, termed Tri-IPC, responsible for the local production of GABAergic neurons, oligodendrocyte precursor cells, and astrocytes. Remarkably, most glioblastoma cells resemble Tri-IPCs at the transcriptomic level, suggesting that cancer cells hijack developmental processes to enhance growth and heterogeneity.

Here, we generate high-resolution maps of genomic interactions with the lamina and speckles in cells of the neurogenic lineage isolated from midgestational human cortex, uncovering an intimate association between subnuclear genome compartmentalization, chromatin state and transcription. During cortical neurogenesis, spatial genome organization is extensively remodeled, relocating hundreds of neuronal genes from the lamina to speckles including key neurodevelopmental genes bivalent for H3K27me3 and H3K4me3. At the lamina, bivalent genes have exceptionally low expression, and relocation to speckles enhances resolution of bivalent chromatin to H3K4me3 and increases transcription \u003e7-fold. We further demonstrate that proximity to the nuclear periphery - not the presence of H3K27me3 - is the dominant factor in maintaining the lowly expressed, poised state of bivalent genes embedded in the lamina.

Understanding the mechanisms for this lineage switch is fundamental for unraveling how proper numbers of diverse neuronal and glial cell types are controlled. We and others recently showed that Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling promotes the cortical RGC lineage switch to generate cortical oligodendrocytes and OB interneurons. During this process, cortical RGCs generate intermediate progenitor cells that express critical gliogenesis genes Ascl1, Egfr, and Olig2. The increased Ascl1 expression and appearance of Egfr(+) and Olig2(+) cortical progenitors are concurrent with the switch from excitatory neurogenesis to gliogenesis and OB interneuron neurogenesis in the cortex. While Shh signaling promotes Olig2 expression in the developing spinal cord, the exact mechanism for this transcriptional regulation is not known. Furthermore, the transcriptional regulation of Olig2 and Egfr has not been explored. Here, we show that in cortical progenitor cells, multiple regulatory programs, including Pax6 and Gli3, prevent precocious expression of Olig2, a gene essential for production of cortical oligodendrocytes and astrocytes. We identify multiple enhancers that control Olig2 expression in cortical progenitors and show that the mechanisms for regulating Olig2 expression are conserved between the mouse and human.

The human EC continues to develop during childhood(5), but neurogenesis and neuronal migration to the EC are widely considered to be complete by birth. Here we show that the human temporal lobe contains many young neurons migrating into the postnatal EC and adjacent regions, with a large tangential stream persisting until the age of around one year and radial dispersal continuing until around two to three years of age. By contrast, we found no equivalent postnatal migration in rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta). Immunostaining and single-nucleus RNA sequencing of ganglionic eminence germinal zones, the EC stream and the postnatal EC revealed that most migrating cells in the EC stream are derived from the caudal ganglionic eminence and become LAMP5(+)RELN(+) inhibitory interneurons. These late-arriving interneurons could continue to shape the processing of sensory and spatial information well into postnatal life, when children are actively interacting with their environment. The EC is one of the first regions of the brain to be affected in Alzheimer's disease, and previous work has linked cognitive decline to the loss of LAMP5(+)RELN(+) cells(6,7).

In humans, the outer radial glia (oRG) subtype is expanded and gives rise to diverse neurons and glia. However, the mechanisms regulating oRG differentiation are unclear. oRG cells express leukemia-inhibitory factor (LIF) receptors during neurogenesis, and consistent with a role in stem cell self-renewal, LIF perturbation impacts oRG proliferation in cortical tissue and organoids. Surprisingly, LIF treatment also increases the production of inhibitory interneurons (INs) in cortical cultures. Comparative transcriptomic analysis identifies that the enhanced IN population resembles INs produced in the caudal ganglionic eminence.

Here we generate a cross-species proteomic map of synapse development in the human, macaque and mouse neocortex. By tracking the changes of more than 1,000 postsynaptic density (PSD) proteins from midgestation to young adulthood, we find that PSD maturation in humans separates into three major phases that are dominated by distinct pathways. Cross-species comparisons reveal that human PSDs mature about two to three times slower than those of other species and contain higher levels of Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors (RhoGEFs) in the perinatal period. Enhancement of RhoGEF signalling in human neurons delays morphological maturation of dendritic spines and functional maturation of synapses, potentially contributing to the neotenic traits of human brain development. In addition, PSD proteins can be divided into four modules that exert stage- and cell-type-specific functions, possibly explaining their differential associations with cognitive functions and diseases.

Due to a higher genetic and phenotypic homogeneity compared to idiopathic autism, dup15q syndrome provides a well-defined setting to investigate ASD mechanisms. Previous bulk gene expression studies identified shared molecular changes in ASD. However, how cell type specific changes compare across different autism subtypes and how they change during development is largely unknown. In this study, we used single cell and single nucleus mRNA sequencing of dup15q cortical organoids from patient iPSCs, as well as post-mortem patient brain samples. We find cell-type specific dysregulated programs that underlie dup15q pathogenesis, which we validate by spatial resolved transcriptomics using brain tissue samples. We find degraded identity and vulnerability of deep-layer neurons in fetal stage organoids and highlight increased molecular burden of postmortem upper-layer neurons implicated in synaptic signaling, a finding shared between idiopathic ASD and dup15q syndrome. Gene co-expression network analysis of organoid and postmortem excitatory neurons uncovers modules enriched with autism risk genes. Organoid developmental modules were involved in transcription regulation via chromatin remodeling, while postmortem modules were associated with synaptic transmission and plasticity.

By performing comparative single-cell transcriptomics in the thalamus and frontal cortex of Grn-/- mice and patients with FTLD-GRN, we have uncovered a highly conserved astroglial pathology characterized by upregulation of gap junction protein GJA1, water channel AQP4, and lipid-binding protein APOE, and downregulation of glutamate transporter SLC1A2 that promoted profound synaptic degeneration across the two species. This astroglial toxicity could be recapitulated in mouse astrocyte-neuron cocultures and by transplanting induced pluripotent stem cell-derived astrocytes to cortical organoids, where progranulin-deficient astrocytes promoted synaptic degeneration, neuronal stress, and TDP-43 proteinopathy.

The species-specific enhancer activity of HARs was accurately predicted from the presence and absence of transcription factor footprints in each species. Despite these striking cis effects, activity of a given HAR sequence was nearly identical in human and chimpanzee cells.

Ninety-seven percent of these patients carry an R206H gain-of-function point mutation in the BMP type I receptor ACVR1 (ACVR1 R206H ), which causes neofunction to Activin A and constitutively activates signaling through phosphorylated SMAD1/5/8. Although patients with FOP can harbor pathological lesions in the peripheral and central nervous system, their etiology and clinical impact are unclear. Quantitative sensory testing of patients with FOP revealed significant heat and mechanical pain hypersensitivity. Although there was no major effect of ACVR1 R206H on differentiation and maturation of nociceptive sensory neurons (iSNs) derived from FOP induced pluripotent stem cells, both intracellular and extracellular electrophysiology analyses of the ACVR1 R206H iSNs displayed ACVR1-dependent hyperexcitability, a hallmark of neuropathic pain. Consistent with this phenotype, we recorded enhanced responses of ACVR1 R206H iSNs to TRPV1 and TRPA1 agonists.

When dissociated hMGE cells are transplanted into the neonatal mouse brain, they reform into nests containing proliferating neuroblasts that generate young neurons that migrate extensively into the mouse forebrain and mature into different subtypes of functional interneurons. Together, these results indicate that the nest organization and sustained proliferation of neuroblasts in the hMGE provide a mechanism for the extended production of interneurons for the human forebrain.","tags":[],"title":"Nests of dividing neuroblasts sustain interneuron production for the developing human brain.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bhaduri A","Neumann EK","Arnold R Kriegstein, MD, PhD","Sweedler JV"],"categories":[],"content":"PubMed ID: 34977897\n","date":1640563200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1640563200,"objectID":"b6f1bafc75be33be06563cc162fb76d1","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/bhaduri-2021-34977897/","publishdate":"2021-12-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bhaduri-2021-34977897/","section":"publication","summary":"The lipidome is currently understudied but fundamental to life.

Early morphogenetic gradients are known to establish early brain regions and cortical areas, but how early patterns result in finer and more discrete spatial differences remains poorly understood(1). Here we use single-cell RNA sequencing to profile ten major brain structures and six neocortical areas during peak neurogenesis and early gliogenesis. Within the neocortex, we find that early in the second trimester, a large number of genes are differentially expressed across distinct cortical areas in all cell types, including radial glia, the neural progenitors of the cortex. However, the abundance of areal transcriptomic signatures increases as radial glia differentiate into intermediate progenitor cells and ultimately give rise to excitatory neurons. Using an automated, multiplexed single-molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization approach, we find that laminar gene-expression patterns are highly dynamic across cortical regions. Together, our data suggest that early cortical areal patterning is defined by strong, mutually exclusive frontal and occipital gene-expression signatures, with resulting gradients giving rise to the specification of areas between these two poles throughout successive developmental timepoints.","tags":[],"title":"An atlas of cortical arealization identifies dynamic molecular signatures.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Haniffa M","Taylor D","Linnarsson S","Aronow BJ","Bader GD","Barker RA","Camara PG","Camp JG","Chedotal A","Copp A","Etchevers HC","Giacobini P","Gottgens B","Guo G","Hupalowska A","James KR","Kirby E","Kriegstein A","Lundeberg J","Marioni JC","Meyer KB","Niakan KK","Nilsson M","Olabi B","Pe'er D","Regev A","Rood J","Rozenblatt-Rosen O","Satija R","Teichmann SA","Treutlein B","Vento-Tormo R","Webb S"],"categories":[],"content":"PubMed ID: 34497388\n","date":1630454400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1630454400,"objectID":"071251c6f7cbcdc280a7cda97aa4aab4","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/haniffa-2021-34497388/","publishdate":"2021-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/haniffa-2021-34497388/","section":"publication","summary":"The Human Developmental Cell Atlas (HDCA) initiative, which is part of the Human Cell Atlas, aims to create a comprehensive reference map of cells during development.

Lamina-associated domain (LAD) architecture in cells in vivo is distinct from that of cultured cells, including major differences in LADs previously considered to be cell type invariant. In the mouse and human forebrain, dorsal and ventral neural precursor cells have differences in LAD architecture that correspond to their regional identity. LADs in the human and mouse cortex contain transcriptionally highly active sub-domains characterized by broad depletion of histone-3-lysine-9 dimethylation. Evolutionarily conserved LADs in human, macaque and mouse brain are enriched for transcriptionally active neural genes associated with synapse function. By integrating GO-CaRT maps with genome-wide association study data, we found speckle-associated domains to be enriched for schizophrenia risk loci, indicating a physical relationship between these disease-associated genetic variants and a specific nuclear structure.

The potential diversity of the nIPC population, that produces a significant portion of excitatory cortical neurons, is understudied, particularly in the developing human brain. Here we explore the spatiotemporal, transcriptomic, and morphological variation that exists within the human nIPC population and provide a resource for future studies. We observe that the spatial distribution of nIPCs in the cortex changes abruptly around gestational week (GW) 19/20, marking a distinct shift in cellular distribution and organization during late neurogenesis. We also identify five transcriptomic subtypes, one of which appears at this spatiotemporal transition. Finally, we observe a diversity of nIPC morphologies that do not correlate with specific transcriptomic subtypes. These results provide an analysis of the spatiotemporal, transcriptional, and morphological diversity of nIPCs in developing brain tissue and provide an atlas of nIPC subtypes in the developing human cortex that can benchmark in vitro models of human development such as cerebral organoids and help inform future studies of how nIPCs contribute to cortical neurogenesis.","tags":[],"title":"Human intermediate progenitor diversity during cortical development.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eze UC","Bhaduri A","Haeussler M","Nowakowski TJ","Arnold R Kriegstein, MD, PhD"],"categories":[],"content":"PubMed ID: 33723434\n","date":1617235200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1617235200,"objectID":"b773eda2a84bfd8b46ecdd1f0d8ff4c1","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/eze-2021-33723434/","publishdate":"2021-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/eze-2021-33723434/","section":"publication","summary":"The human cortex comprises diverse cell types that emerge from an initially uniform neuroepithelium that gives rise to radial glia, the neural stem cells of the cortex.

To assess whether human cortical cells can be directly infected by SARS-CoV-2, we utilized primary human cortical tissue and stem cell-derived cortical organoids. We find significant and predominant infection in cortical astrocytes in both primary and organoid cultures, with minimal infection of other cortical populations. Infected astrocytes had a corresponding increase in reactivity characteristics, growth factor signaling, and cellular stress. Although human cortical cells, including astrocytes, have minimal ACE2 expression, we find high levels of alternative coronavirus receptors in infected astrocytes, including DPP4 and CD147.

Here we use single-nucleus RNA sequencing to show that progranulin deficiency promotes microglial transition from a homeostatic to a disease-specific state that causes endolysosomal dysfunction and neurodegeneration in mice. These defects persist even when Grn(-/-) microglia are cultured ex vivo. In addition, single-nucleus RNA sequencing reveals selective loss of excitatory neurons at disease end-stage, which is characterized by prominent nuclear and cytoplasmic TDP-43 granules and nuclear pore defects. Remarkably, conditioned media from Grn(-/-) microglia are sufficient to promote TDP-43 granule formation, nuclear pore defects and cell death in excitatory neurons via the complement activation pathway. Consistent with these results, deletion of the genes encoding C1qa and C3 mitigates microglial toxicity and rescues TDP-43 proteinopathy and neurodegeneration. These results uncover previously unappreciated contributions of chronic microglial toxicity to TDP-43 proteinopathy during neurodegeneration.","tags":[],"title":"Neurotoxic microglia promote TDP-43 proteinopathy in progranulin deficiency.","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Congratulations to Richard Hendricks for winning first place in the Wowchemy Prize.\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

Here we characterize cell-type-specific cis-regulatory chromatin interactions, open chromatin peaks, and transcriptomes for radial glia, intermediate progenitor cells, excitatory neurons, and interneurons isolated from mid-gestational samples of the human cortex. We show that chromatin interactions underlie several aspects of gene regulation, with transposable elements and disease-associated variants enriched at distal interacting regions in a cell-type-specific manner. In addition, promoters with increased levels of chromatin interactivity-termed super-interactive promoters-are enriched for lineage-specific genes, suggesting that interactions at these loci contribute to the fine-tuning of transcription. Finally, we develop CRISPRview, a technique that integrates immunostaining, CRISPR interference, RNAscope, and image analysis to validate cell-type-specific cis-regulatory elements in heterogeneous populations of primary cells.

We find that dysregulation of mTOR signaling specifically affects oRG cells, but not other progenitor types, by changing the actin cytoskeleton through the activity of the Rho-GTPase, CDC42. These effects change oRG cellular morphology, migration, and mitotic behavior, but do not affect proliferation or cell fate. Thus, mTOR signaling can regulate the architecture of the developing human cortex by maintaining the cytoskeletal organization of oRG cells and the radial glia scaffold.

ASD is characterized by social deficits and a range of other phenotypes, implicating complex genetics and involvement of a variety of brain regions. However, how mutations and mis-expression of select gene sets are associated with the behavioral components of ASD remains unknown. We reasoned that for genes to be associated with ASD core behaviors they must be: (1) expressed in brain regions relevant to ASD social behaviors and (2) expressed during the ASD susceptible window of brain development. METHODS: Focusing on the amygdala, a brain region whose dysfunction has been highly implicated in the social component of ASD, we mined publicly available gene expression databases to identify ASD-susceptibility genes expressed during human and mouse amygdala development. We found that a large cohort of known ASD susceptibility genes is expressed in the developing human and mouse amygdala. We further performed analysis of single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) data from microdissected amygdala tissue from five ASD and five control human postmortem brains ranging in age from 4 to 20 years to elucidate cell type specificity of amygdala-expressed genes and their dysregulation in ASD. RESULTS: Our analyses revealed that of the high-ranking ASD susceptibility genes, 80 are expressed in both human and mouse amygdala during fetal to early postnatal stages of development. Our human snRNA-seq analyses revealed cohorts of genes with altered expression in the ASD amygdala postnatally, especially within excitatory neurons, with dysregulated expression of seven genes predicted from our datamining pipeline. LIMITATIONS: We were limited by the ages for which we were able to obtain human tissue; therefore, the results from our datamining pipeline approach will require validation, to the extent possible, in human tissue from earlier developmental stages. CONCLUSIONS: Our pipeline narrows down the number of amygdala-expressed genes possibly involved in the social pathophysiology of ASD. Our human single-nucleus gene expression analyses revealed that ASD is characterized by changes in gene expression in specific cell types in the early postnatal amygdala.","tags":[],"title":"Identification of amygdala-expressed genes associated with autism spectrum disorder.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Selvadurai HJ","Luis E","Desai K","Lan X","Vladoiu MC","Whitley O","Galvin C","Vanner RJ","Lee L","Whetstone H","Kushida M","Nowakowski T","Diamandis P","Hawkins C","Bader G","Kriegstein A","Taylor MD","Dirks PB"],"categories":[],"content":"PubMed ID: 32294450\n","date":1586822400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1586822400,"objectID":"5b46aac9a7cbf9879d233413ff0a5aaa","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/selvadurai-2020-32294450/","publishdate":"2020-04-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/selvadurai-2020-32294450/","section":"publication","summary":"Medulloblastoma (MB) is a neoplasm linked to dysregulated cerebellar development.

Through lineage tracing and single-cell analysis, we demonstrate that these Sox2(+) cells are within the Atoh1(+) lineage, contribute extensively to adult granule neurons, and resemble Sox2(+) tumor cells. Critically, constitutive activation of the SHH pathway leads to their aberrant persistence in the EGL and rapid tumor onset.

Herein, we provide evidence for the molecular mechanism that underlies this switch in the state of neocortical NSCs. We show that, at around E16.5, mouse neocortical NSCs start to generate GSX2-expressing (GSX2(+)) intermediate progenitor cells (IPCs). In vivo lineage-tracing study revealed that GSX2(+) IPC population gives rise not only to OB interneurons but also to cortical oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, suggesting that they are a tri-potential population. We demonstrated that Sonic hedgehog signaling is both necessary and sufficient for the generation of GSX2(+) IPCs by reducing GLI3R protein levels.

By contrast, organoids contain broad cell classes, but do not recapitulate distinct cellular subtype identities and appropriate progenitor maturation. Although the molecular signatures of cortical areas emerge in organoid neurons, they are not spatially segregated.

It is unclear whether mesenchymal GSCs (mGSC) and/or proneural GSCs (pGSC) alone are sufficient to generate the heterogeneity observed in GBM. We performed single-cell/single-nucleus RNA sequencing of 28 gliomas, and single-cell ATAC sequencing for 8 cases. We found that GBM GSCs reside on a single axis of variation, ranging from proneural to mesenchymal. In silico lineage tracing using both transcriptomics and genetics supports mGSCs as the progenitors of pGSCs. Dual inhibition of pGSC-enriched and mGSC-enriched growth and survival pathways provides a more complete treatment than combinations targeting one GSC phenotype alone. This study sheds light on a long-standing debate regarding lineage relationships among GSCs and presents a paradigm by which personalized combination therapies can be derived from single-cell RNA signatures, to overcome intratumor heterogeneity. SIGNIFICANCE: Tumor-propagating cells can be derived from mesenchymal and proneural glioblastomas. However, a stem cell of the classic subtype has yet to be demonstrated. We show that classic-subtype gliomas are comprised of proneural and mesenchymal cells.

Rodent models are extremely valuable for the investigation of brain development, but cannot provide insight into aspects that are unique or highly derived in humans. Many human psychiatric and neurological conditions have developmental origins but cannot be studied adequately in animal models. The human cerebral cortex has some unique genetic, molecular, cellular and anatomical features, which need to be further explored. The Anatomical Society devoted its summer meeting to the topic of Human Brain Development in June 2018 to tackle these important issues. The meeting was organized by Gavin Clowry (Newcastle University) and Zoltan Molnar (University of Oxford), and held at St John's College, Oxford. The participants provided a broad overview of the structure of the human brain in the context of scaling relationships across the brains of mammals, conserved principles and recent changes in the human lineage. Speakers considered how neuronal progenitors diversified in human to generate an increasing variety of cortical neurons. The formation of the earliest cortical circuits of the earliest generated neurons in the subplate was discussed together with their involvement in neurodevelopmental pathologies. Gene expression networks and susceptibility genes associated to neurodevelopmental diseases were discussed and compared with the networks that can be identified in organoids developed from induced pluripotent stem cells that recapitulate some aspects of in vivo development. New views were discussed on the specification of glutamatergic pyramidal and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic interneurons. With the advancement of various in vivo imaging methods, the histopathological observations can be now linked to in vivo normal conditions and to various diseases. Our review gives a general evaluation of the exciting new developments in these areas. The human cortex has a much enlarged association cortex with greater interconnectivity of cortical areas with each other and with an expanded thalamus. The human cortex has relative enlargement of the upper layers, enhanced diversity and function of inhibitory interneurons and a highly expanded transient subplate layer during development. Here we highlight recent studies that address how these differences emerge during development focusing on diverse facets of our evolution.","tags":[],"title":"New insights into the development of the human cerebral cortex.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sorrells SF","Paredes MF","Velmeshev D","Herranz-Perez V","Sandoval K","Mayer S","Chang EF","Insausti R","Arnold R Kriegstein, MD, PhD","Rubenstein JL","Manuel Garcia-Verdugo J","Huang EJ","Alvarez-Buylla A"],"categories":[],"content":"PubMed ID: 31227709\n","date":1561075200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561075200,"objectID":"8d4f87c2b920141d4ec4c6e271275ad8","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/sorrells-2019-31227709/","publishdate":"2019-06-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sorrells-2019-31227709/","section":"publication","summary":"The human amygdala grows during childhood, and its abnormal development is linked to mood disorders. The primate amygdala contains a large population of immature neurons in the paralaminar nuclei (PL), suggesting protracted development and possibly neurogenesis. Here we studied human PL development from embryonic stages to adulthood. The PL develops next to the caudal ganglionic eminence, which generates inhibitory interneurons, yet most PL neurons express excitatory markers. In children, most PL cells are immature (DCX+PSA-NCAM+), and during adolescence many transition into mature (TBR1+VGLUT2+) neurons. Immature PL neurons persist into old age, yet local progenitor proliferation sharply decreases in infants. Using single nuclei RNA sequencing, we identify the transcriptional profile of immature excitatory neurons in the human amygdala between 4-15 years. We conclude that the human PL contains excitatory neurons that remain immature for decades, a possible substrate for persistent plasticity at the interface of the hippocampus and amygdala.","tags":[],"title":"Immature excitatory neurons develop during adolescence in the human amygdala.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Miller DJ","Bhaduri A","Sestan N","Kriegstein A"],"categories":[],"content":"PubMed ID: 30677551\n","date":1559347200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1559347200,"objectID":"e0f4a91488e5c2c4ec24917c2c334ecd","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/miller-2019-30677551/","publishdate":"2019-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/miller-2019-30677551/","section":"publication","summary":"The cerebral cortex is the hallmark of the mammalian nervous system, and its large size and cellular diversity in humans support our most sophisticated cognitive abilities.

By combining multiple complementary approaches, high-throughput sequencing of RNA isolated by cross-linking immunoprecipitation with an antibody to AGO2 (AGO2-HITS-CLIP), single-cell profiling and computational analyses using bipartite and coexpression networks, we show that miRNA-mRNA interactions operate as functional modules that often correspond to cell-type identities and undergo dynamic transitions during brain development.

However, the efficient generation of such atlases will depend on sufficient sampling of diverse cell types while remaining cost-effective to enable a comprehensive examination of organs, developmental stages, and individuals. RESULTS: To examine the relationship between sampled cell numbers and transcriptional heterogeneity in the context of unbiased cell type classification, we explored the population structure of a publicly available 1.3 million cell dataset from E18.5 mouse brain and validated our findings in published data from adult mice. We propose a computational framework for inferring the saturation point of cluster discovery in a single-cell mRNA-seq experiment, centered around cluster preservation in downsampled datasets. In addition, we introduce a \"complexity index,\" which characterizes the heterogeneity of cells in a given dataset. Using Cajal-Retzius cells as an example of a limited complexity dataset, we explored whether the detected biological distinctions relate to technical clustering. Surprisingly, we found that clustering distinctions carrying biologically interpretable meaning are achieved with far fewer cells than the originally sampled, though technical saturation of rare populations such as Cajal-Retzius cells is not achieved. We additionally validated these findings with a recently published atlas of cell types across mouse organs and again find using subsampling that a much smaller number of cells recapitulates the cluster distinctions of the complete dataset. CONCLUSIONS: Together, these findings suggest that most of the biologically interpretable cell types from the 1.3 million cell database can be recapitulated by analyzing 50,000 randomly selected cells, indicating that instead of profiling few individuals at high \"cellular coverage,\" cell atlas studies may instead benefit from profiling more individuals, or many time points at lower cellular coverage and then further enriching for populations of interest. This strategy is ideal for scenarios where cost and time are limited, though extremely rare populations of interest (\u003c 1%) may be identifiable only with much higher cell numbers.","tags":[],"title":"Identification of cell types in a mouse brain single-cell atlas using low sampling coverage.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Raju CS","Spatazza J","Stanco A","Larimer P","Sorrells SF","Kelley KW","Nicholas CR","Paredes MF","Lui JH","Hasenstaub AR","Arnold R Kriegstein, MD, PhD","Alvarez-Buylla A","Rubenstein JL","Oldham MC"],"categories":[],"content":"PubMed ID: 28449024\n","date":1527811200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1527811200,"objectID":"98a79c0c3ae094af9dacade52716af58","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/raju-2018-28449024/","publishdate":"2018-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/raju-2018-28449024/","section":"publication","summary":"The neocortex of primates, including humans, contains more abundant and diverse inhibitory neurons compared with rodents, but the molecular foundations of these observations are unknown.

Functional analysis reveals that different alleles of NOTCH2NL have varying potencies to enhance Notch signaling by interacting directly with NOTCH receptors. Consistent with a role in Notch signaling, NOTCH2NL ectopic expression delays differentiation of neuronal progenitors, while deletion accelerates differentiation into cortical neurons. Furthermore, NOTCH2NL genes provide the breakpoints in 1q21.1 distal deletion/duplication syndrome, where duplications are associated with macrocephaly and autism and deletions with microcephaly and schizophrenia. Thus, the emergence of human-specific NOTCH2NL genes may have contributed to the rapid evolution of the larger human neocortex, accompanied by loss of genomic stability at the 1q21.1 locus and resulting recurrent neurodevelopmental disorders.","tags":[],"title":"Human-Specific NOTCH2NL Genes Affect Notch Signaling and Cortical Neurogenesis.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Werling DM","Brand H","An JY","Stone MR","Zhu L","Glessner JT","Collins RL","Dong S","Layer RM","Markenscoff-Papadimitriou E","Farrell A","Schwartz GB","Wang HZ","Currall BB","Zhao X","Dea J","Duhn C","Erdman CA","Gilson MC","Yadav R","Handsaker RE","Kashin S","Klei L","Mandell JD","Nowakowski TJ","Liu Y","Pochareddy S","Smith L","Walker MF","Waterman MJ","He X","Arnold R Kriegstein, MD, PhD","Rubenstein JL","Sestan N","McCarroll SA","Neale BM","Coon H","Willsey AJ","Buxbaum JD","Daly MJ","State MW","Quinlan AR","Marth GT","Roeder K","Devlin B","Talkowski ME","Sanders SJ"],"categories":[],"content":"PubMed ID: 29700473\n","date":1524700800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1524700800,"objectID":"d7f951f077da470039f97924cfffacda","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/werling-2018-29700473/","publishdate":"2018-04-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/werling-2018-29700473/","section":"publication","summary":"Genomic association studies of common or rare protein-coding variation have established robust statistical approaches to account for multiple testing.

Despite these discrepancies, it is generally believed that the adult human hippocampus continues to generate new neurons. Here we show that a defined population of progenitor cells does not coalesce in the subgranular zone during human fetal or postnatal development. We also find that the number of proliferating progenitors and young neurons in the dentate gyrus declines sharply during the first year of life and only a few isolated young neurons are observed by 7 and 13 years of age. In adult patients with epilepsy and healthy adults (18-77 years; n = 17 post-mortem samples from controls; n = 12 surgical resection samples from patients with epilepsy), young neurons were not detected in the dentate gyrus. In the monkey (Macaca mulatta) hippocampus, proliferation of neurons in the subgranular zone was found in early postnatal life, but this diminished during juvenile development as neurogenesis decreased. We conclude that recruitment of young neurons to the primate hippocampus decreases rapidly during the first years of life, and that neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus does not continue, or is extremely rare, in adult humans.

It is unknown to what extent macrophages derived from peripheral blood adopt the phenotype of brain-resident microglia in pre-treatment gliomas. The relative proportions of blood-derived macrophages and microglia have been poorly quantified in clinical samples due to a paucity of markers that distinguish these cell types in malignant tissue. RESULTS: We perform single-cell RNA-sequencing of human gliomas and identify phenotypic differences in TAMs of distinct lineages. We isolate TAMs from patient biopsies and compare them with macrophages from non-malignant human tissue, glioma atlases, and murine glioma models. We present a novel signature that distinguishes TAMs by ontogeny in human gliomas. Blood-derived TAMs upregulate immunosuppressive cytokines and show an altered metabolism compared to microglial TAMs. They are also enriched in perivascular and necrotic regions. The gene signature of blood-derived TAMs, but not microglial TAMs, correlates with significantly inferior survival in low-grade glioma. Surprisingly, TAMs frequently co-express canonical pro-inflammatory (M1) and alternatively activated (M2) genes in individual cells. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that blood-derived TAMs significantly infiltrate pre-treatment gliomas, to a degree that varies by glioma subtype and tumor compartment.

We identify the brain cell populations that are most susceptible to ZIKV infection in primary human tissue, provide evidence for a mechanism of viral entry, and show that a commonly used antibiotic protects cultured brain cells by reducing viral proliferation. In the brain, ZIKV preferentially infected neural stem cells, astrocytes, oligodendrocyte precursor cells, and microglia, whereas neurons were less susceptible to infection. These findings suggest mechanisms for microcephaly and other pathologic features of infants with congenital ZIKV infection that are not explained by neural stem cell infection alone, such as calcifications in the cortical plate. Furthermore, we find that blocking the glia-enriched putative viral entry receptor AXL reduced ZIKV infection of astrocytes in vitro, and genetic knockdown of AXL in a glial cell line nearly abolished infection. Finally, we evaluate 2,177 compounds, focusing on drugs safe in pregnancy. We show that the macrolide antibiotic azithromycin reduced viral proliferation and virus-induced cytopathic effects in glial cell lines and human astrocytes.

Furthermore, it has been unclear whether lncRNAs are highly expressed in subsets of cells within tissues, despite appearing lowly expressed in bulk populations. RESULTS: We use strand-specific RNA-seq to deeply profile lncRNAs from polyadenylated and total RNA obtained from human neocortex at different stages of development, and we apply this reference to analyze the transcriptomes of single cells. While lncRNAs are generally detected at low levels in bulk tissues, single-cell transcriptomics of hundreds of neocortex cells reveal that many lncRNAs are abundantly expressed in individual cells and are cell type-specific. Notably, LOC646329 is a lncRNA enriched in single radial glia cells but is detected at low abundance in tissues. CRISPRi knockdown of LOC646329 indicates that this lncRNA regulates cell proliferation.

In the lissencephalic rodent brain, pyramidal neurons are born in the ventricular and subventricular zones of the pallium and migrate along radial glia fibers to reach the appropriate cortical layer. Although much less is known about neuronal migration in species with a gyrencephalic cortex, retroviral studies in the ferret and primate suggest that, unlike the rodent, pyramidal neurons do not follow strict radial pathways and instead can disperse horizontally. However, the means by which pyramidal neurons laterally disperse remain unknown. In this study, we identified a viral labeling technique for visualizing neuronal migration in the ferret, a gyrencephalic carnivore, and found that migration was predominantly radial at early postnatal ages. In contrast, neurons displayed more tortuous migration routes with a decreased frequency of cortical plate-directed migration at later stages of neurogenesis concomitant with the start of brain folding. This was accompanied by neurons migrating sequentially along several different radial glial fibers, suggesting a mode by which pyramidal neurons may laterally disperse in a folded cortex. These findings provide insight into the migratory behavior of neurons in gyrencephalic species and provide a framework for using nonrodent model systems for studying neuronal migration disorders. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Elucidating neuronal migration dynamics in the gyrencephalic, or folded, cortex is important for understanding neurodevelopmental disorders. Similar to the rodent, we found that neuronal migration was predominantly radial at early postnatal ages in the gyrencephalic ferret cortex. Interestingly, ferret neurons displayed more tortuous migration routes and a decreased frequency of radial migration at later ages coincident with the start of cortical folding. We found that ferret neurons use several different radial glial fibers as migratory guides, including those belonging to the recently described outer radial glia, suggesting a mechanism by which ferret neurons disperse laterally. It is likely that excitatory neurons horizontally disperse in other gyrencephalic mammals, including the primate, suggesting an important modification to the current model deduced primarily from the rodent.","tags":[],"title":"Neuronal Migration Dynamics in the Developing Ferret Cortex.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pollen AA","Nowakowski TJ","Chen J","Retallack H","Sandoval-Espinosa C","Nicholas CR","Shuga J","Liu SJ","Oldham MC","Diaz A","Lim DA","Leyrat AA","West JA","Arnold R Kriegstein, MD, PhD"],"categories":[],"content":"PubMed ID: 26406371\n","date":1443052800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1443052800,"objectID":"7662c629be52d1380d5b28da0b051323","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/pollen-2015-26406371/","publishdate":"2015-09-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pollen-2015-26406371/","section":"publication","summary":"Radial glia, the neural stem cells of the neocortex, are located in two niches: the ventricular zone and outer subventricular zone.

Here we show that the transcriptional profiles of human and mouse neocortical RG are broadly conserved during neurogenesis, yet diverge for specific signalling pathways. By analysing differential gene co-expression relationships between the species, we demonstrate that the growth factor PDGFD is specifically expressed by RG in human, but not mouse, corticogenesis. We also show that the expression domain of PDGFRbeta, the cognate receptor for PDGFD, is evolutionarily divergent, with high expression in the germinal region of dorsal human neocortex but not in the mouse. Pharmacological inhibition of PDGFD-PDGFRbeta signalling in slice culture prevents normal cell cycle progression of neocortical RG in human, but not mouse. Conversely, injection of recombinant PDGFD or ectopic expression of constitutively active PDGFRbeta in developing mouse neocortex increases the proportion of RG and their subventricular dispersion.

In contrast, the neurogenic competence of Ink4a/Arf-deficient astroglia is both greatly increased and does not diminish through serial cell culture passage.

Finally, we found that mouse fibroblasts deficient for Ink4a/Arf also exhibit greatly enhanced transcription factor-induced neuronal induction.

Rings form after fusion of the long and short arms of a chromosome, and are sometimes associated with large terminal deletions. Owing to the severity of these large aberrations that can affect multiple contiguous genes, no possible therapeutic strategies for ring chromosome disorders have been proposed. During cell division, ring chromosomes can exhibit unstable behaviour leading to continuous production of aneuploid progeny with low viability and high cellular death rate. The overall consequences of this chromosomal instability have been largely unexplored in experimental model systems. Here we generated human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from patient fibroblasts containing ring chromosomes with large deletions and found that reprogrammed cells lost the abnormal chromosome and duplicated the wild-type homologue through the compensatory uniparental disomy (UPD) mechanism. The karyotypically normal iPSCs with isodisomy for the corrected chromosome outgrew co-existing aneuploid populations, enabling rapid and efficient isolation of patient-derived iPSCs devoid of the original chromosomal aberration. Our results suggest a fundamentally different function for cellular reprogramming as a means of 'chromosome therapy' to reverse combined loss-of-function across many genes in cells with large-scale aberrations involving ring structures.

NKCC1 facilitates seizures because it renders GABA activity excitatory through intracellular Cl(-) accumulation, while blocking NKCC1 with bumetanide suppresses seizures. Bumetanide is currently being tested in clinical trials for treatment of neonatal seizures. By blocking NKCC1 with bumetanide during cortical development, we found a critical period for the development of alpha-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionate synapses. Disruption of GABA signaling during this window resulted in permanent decreases in excitatory synaptic transmission and sensorimotor gating deficits, a common feature in schizophrenia.

Excitatory pyramidal neurons originate near the ventricle and migrate radially to their position in the cortical plate along radial glial fibers. On the other hand, inhibitory interneurons arise in the ventral telencephalon and migrate tangentially to enter the developing cortex before migrating radially to reach their correct laminar position. Gap junction adhesion has been shown to play an important mechanistic role in the radial migration of excitatory neurons. We asked whether a similar mechanism governs the tangential or radial migration of inhibitory interneurons. Using short hairpin RNA knockdown of Connexin 43 (Cx43) and Cx26 together with rescue experiments, we found that gap junctions are dispensable for the tangential migration of interneurons, but that Cx43 plays a role in the switch from tangential to radial migration that allows interneurons to enter the cortical plate and find their correct laminar position. Moreover this action is dependent on the adhesive properties and the C terminus of Cx43 but not the Cx43 channel.

Accumulating evidence suggests that neuronal activity plays an important role in achieving such a balance in the developing cortex, but the mechanism that regulates this process is unknown. During development, GABA, the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in adults, excites neurons as a result of high expression of the Na(+)-K(+)-2Cl(-) cotransporter (NKCC1). Using NKCC1 RNA interference knockdown in vivo, we show that GABA-induced depolarization is necessary for proper excitatory synapse formation and dendritic development of newborn cortical neurons. Blocking NKCC1 with the diuretic bumetanide during development leads to similar persistent changes in cortical circuitry in the adult. Interestingly, expression of a voltage-independent NMDA receptor rescues the failure of NKCC1 knockdown neurons to develop excitatory AMPA transmission, indicating that GABA depolarization cooperates with NMDA receptor activation to regulate excitatory synapse formation.

In Drosophila, cleavage plane orientation dictates the inheritance of fate-determinants and the symmetry of newborn daughter cells during neuroblast cell divisions. One model for predicting daughter cell fate in the mammalian neocortex is also based on cleavage plane orientation. Precursor cell divisions with a cleavage plane orientation that is perpendicular with respect to the ventricular surface (vertical) are predicted to be symmetric, while divisions with a cleavage plane orientation that is parallel to the surface (horizontal) are predicted to be asymmetric neurogenic divisions. However, analysis of cleavage plane orientation at the ventricle suggests that the number of predicted neurogenic divisions might be insufficient to produce large amounts of cortical neurons. To understand factors that correlate with the symmetry of cell divisions, we examined rat neocortical precursor cells in situ through real-time imaging, marker analysis, and electrophysiological recordings. We find that cleavage plane orientation is more closely associated with precursor cell type than with daughter cell fate, as commonly thought. Radial glia cells in the VZ primarily divide with a vertical orientation throughout cortical development and undergo symmetric or asymmetric self-renewing divisions depending on the stage of development. In contrast, most intermediate progenitor cells divide in the subventricular zone with a horizontal orientation and produce symmetric daughter cells.

These results indicate that gap junction adhesions are necessary for glial-guided neuronal migration, raising the possibility that the adhesive properties of gap junctions may have an important role in other physiological processes and diseases associated with gap junction function.","tags":[],"title":"Gap junction adhesion is necessary for radial migration in the neocortex.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Noctor SC","Martinez-Cerdeno V","Arnold R Kriegstein, MD, PhD"],"categories":[],"content":"PubMed ID: 17502462\n","date":1177977600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1177977600,"objectID":"d1167c00c126ebc6406119eebae0422c","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/noctor-2007-17502462/","publishdate":"2007-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/noctor-2007-17502462/","section":"publication","summary":"The mammalian cerebral cortex is the most cellularly complex structure in the animal kingdom.

E2 also stimulates neurogenesis in the adult dentate gyrus. We examined the role of E2 during embryonic cortical neurogenesis through immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, functional enzyme assay, organotypic culture and in utero administration of estradiol-blocking agents in mice. We show that aromatase, the E2 synthesizing enzyme, is present in the embryonic neocortex, that estrogen receptor-alpha is present in progenitor cells during cortical neurogenesis, that in vitro E2 administration rapidly promotes proliferation, and that in utero blockade of estrogen receptors decreases proliferation of embryonic cortical progenitor cells. Furthermore, the E2 inhibitor alpha-fetoprotein is expressed at high levels by radial glial cells but at lower levels by intermediate progenitor cells, suggesting that E2 differentially influences the proliferation of these cortical progenitor cell types.

Whereas traditionally it was thought that glial and neuronal cells were separate cell lines with different lineages, we now know that this is not true. Radial glia are a type of neural stem cell that generate excitatory pyramidal neurons directly through asymmetric cell division in the ventricular zone (VZ) of the telencephalon and indirectly through the symmetric division of daughter intermediate precursor cells that divide in the subventricular zone (SVZ). Moreover, pyramidal neurons, once thought to migrate only along radial guide fibers to the developing layers of the cortex, have been shown to proceed through four distinct stages of migration during which they change shape, direction, and speed. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABAergic) inhibitory interneurons, on the other hand, are generated not in the cortex, but in the medial ganglionic eminence and migrate tangentially to their final cortical destinations. Evidence suggests that GABA activation may play a role in coordinating the generation and migration of both pyramidal and interneuron populations. At the end of neurogenesis, radial glial cells translocate to the cortex and transform into astrocytes. Although they do not actively divide in the adult brain, astrocytes may retain the potential to generate new neurons.

Integrating these findings with the molecular machinery underlying migration will provide a more complete picture of how the cerebral cortex is assembled.","tags":[],"title":"Patterns of neuronal migration in the embryonic cortex.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Noctor SC","Martinez-Cerdeno V","Ivic L","Arnold R Kriegstein, MD, PhD"],"categories":[],"content":"PubMed ID: 14703572\n","date":1075593600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1075593600,"objectID":"6a61dbe589d2ad0bad488d9ab2f30f9f","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/noctor-2004-14703572/","publishdate":"2004-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/noctor-2004-14703572/","section":"publication","summary":"Precise patterns of cell division and migration are crucial to transform the neuroepithelium of the embryonic forebrain into the adult cerebral cortex. Using time-lapse imaging of clonal cells in rat cortex over several generations, we show here that neurons are generated in two proliferative zones by distinct patterns of division. Neurons arise directly from radial glial cells in the ventricular zone (VZ) and indirectly from intermediate progenitor cells in the subventricular zone (SVZ). Furthermore, newborn neurons do not migrate directly to the cortex; instead, most exhibit four distinct phases of migration, including a phase of retrograde movement toward the ventricle before migration to the cortical plate.

Terpene trilactones (ginkgolides and bilobalide) are unique constituents of Ginkgo biloba extracts that have various effects on the central nervous system. We have investigated the relative potency of these compounds on glycine and GABA(A) receptors. We find that most of the ginkgolides are selective and potent antagonists of the glycine receptor. Bilobalide, the single major component in G. biloba extracts, also reduces glycine-induced currents, although to a lesser extent. Both ginkgolides and bilobalide inhibit GABA(A) receptors, with bilobalide demonstrating a more potent effect. Additionally, we provide evidence that open channels are required for glycine receptor inhibition by ginkgolides. Finally, we employ molecular modeling to elucidate the similarities and differences in the structure of the terpene trilactones to account for the pharmacological properties of these compounds and demonstrate a striking similarity between ginkgolides and picrotoxinin, a GABA(A) and recombinant glycine alpha-homomeric receptor antagonist.","tags":[],"title":"Terpene trilactones from Ginkgo biloba are antagonists of cortical glycine and GABA(A) receptors.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Arnold R Kriegstein, MD, PhD","Gotz M"],"categories":[],"content":"PubMed ID: 12761864\n","date":1057017600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1057017600,"objectID":"8187f13dfc134fc1046c31aabfc58b95","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/kriegstein-2003-12761864/","publishdate":"2003-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kriegstein-2003-12761864/","section":"publication","summary":"Early in development of the central nervous system, radial glial cells arise from the neuroepithelial cells lining the ventricles around the time that neurons begin to appear.

However, not all radial glia are alike. Radial glial lineages appear to be heterogeneous both within and across different brain regions. Subtypes of neurogenic radial glia within the cortex, for example, may have restricted potential in terms of the cell types they are able to generate. Radial glia located in different brain regions also differ in their expression of growth factors, a diverse number of transcription factors, and the cell types they generate, suggesting that they are involved in regionalization of the developing nervous system in several aspects.

We demonstrate here that most dividing progenitor cells in the embryonic human VZ express radial glial proteins. Furthermore, we provide evidence that radial glial cells maintain a vimentin-positive radial fiber throughout each stage of cell division. Asymmetric inheritance of this fiber may be an important factor in determining how neuronal progeny will migrate into the developing cortical plate.

The mechanism underlying seizures with cortical malformations is still poorly understood. To study the physiology of dysplastic cortex, we developed an experimental model of CD. METHODS: Pregnant rats were given intraperitoneal injections of carmustine (1-3-bis-chloroethyl-nitrosourea; BCNU) on embryonic day 15 (E15). Cortical histology was examined in the resulting pups at P0, P28, and P60. In addition, evoked and spontaneous field potential recordings were obtained in cortical slices from adult control and BCNU-exposed rats. Finally, we used whole-cell recordings to compare physiologic properties of pyramidal neurons and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) responses in control and BCNU-treated animals. RESULTS: Features characteristic of CD were found in the offspring, including laminar disorganization, cytomegalic neurons, and neuronal heterotopias. Dysplastic cortex also contained abnormal clusters of Cajal-Retzius (CR) cells and disruption of radial glial fibers, as demonstrated with immunohistochemistry. Under conditions of partial GABAA-receptor blockade with 10 microM bicuculline methiodide (BMI), slices of dysplastic cortex demonstrated a significant increase in the number of spontaneous and evoked epileptiform discharges. Individual pyramidal neurons in dysplastic cortex were less sensitive to application of GABA compared with controls. CONCLUSIONS: BCNU exposure in utero produces histologic alterations suggestive of CD in rat offspring. Dysplastic cortex from this model demonstrates features of hyperexcitability and decreased neuronal sensitivity to GABA. Such physiologic alterations may underlie the increased epileptogenicity of dysplastic cortex.","tags":[],"title":"Increased excitability and decreased sensitivity to GABA in an animal model of dysplastic cortex.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Owens DF","Arnold R Kriegstein, MD, PhD"],"categories":[],"content":"PubMed ID: 12209120\n","date":1030838400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1030838400,"objectID":"b40dd8fcc1327271cb9d0289ee03959b","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/owens-2002-12209120/","publishdate":"2002-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/owens-2002-12209120/","section":"publication","summary":"In the mature brain, GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) functions primarily as an inhibitory neurotransmitter.

However, the functional properties of GABA receptor signalling in the immature brain are significantly different from, and in some ways opposite to, those found in the adult brain.

The latter two cell classes have been assumed for some time to be distinct in both function and anatomy, but the cellular anatomy of the progenitor cell type has remained poorly defined. Several recent reports have raised doubts about the distinction between radial glial and precursor cells by demonstrating that radial glial cells are themselves neuronal progenitor cells (Malatesta et al., 2000; Hartfuss et al., 2001; Miyata et al., 2001; Noctor et al., 2001). This discovery raises the possibility that radial glia and the population of VZ progenitor cells may be one anatomical and functional cell class. Such a hypothesis predicts that throughout neurogenesis almost all mitotically active VZ cells and a substantial percentage of VZ cells overall are radial glia. We have therefore used various anatomical, immunohistochemical, and electrophysiological techniques to test these predictions. Our data demonstrate that the majority of VZ cells, and nearly all mitotically active VZ cells during neurogenesis, both have radial glial morphology and express radial glial markers. In addition, intracellular dye filling of electrophysiologically characterized progenitor cells in the VZ demonstrates that these cells have the morphology of radial glia. Because the vast majority cycling cells in the cortical VZ have characteristics of radial glia, the radial glial precursor cell may be responsible for both the production of newborn neurons and the guidance of daughter neurons to their destinations in the developing cortex.","tags":[],"title":"Dividing precursor cells of the embryonic cortical ventricular zone have morphological and molecular characteristics of radial glia.","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"6d99026b9e19e4fa43d5aadf147c7176","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/contact/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/contact/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"c1d17ff2b20dca0ad6653a3161942b64","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/people/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/people/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"62e746d611f01d3a2e46e129a3caf46c","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/datasets/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/datasets/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Datasets","type":"widget_page"}]
