This study elucidates the role of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in progenitor cells and radial glia (RG) during human cortical development. We identify two nAChR subunits-CHRNA7 and the human-specific CHRFAM7A-expressed in SOX2+ progenitors and neurons, with CHRFAM7A particularly enriched along RG endfeet. nAChR activation in organotypic slices and dissociated cultures increases RG proliferation while decreasing neuronal differentiation, whereas nAChR knockdown reduces RG and increases neurons. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals that nicotine exposure downregulates key genes in excitatory neurons (ENs), with CHRNA7 or CHRFAM7A selectively modulating these changes, suggesting an evolutionary divergence in regulatory pathways. Furthermore, we identify YAP1 as a critical downstream effector of nAChR signaling, and inhibiting YAP1 reverses nicotine-induced phenotypic alterations in oRG cells, highlighting its role in nicotine-induced neurodevelopmental pathophysiology.","tags":null,"title":"alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors regulate radial glia fate in the developing human cortex","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mostajo-Radji MA","Leon WRM","Breevoort A","Gonzalez-Ferrer J","Schweiger HE","Lehrer J","Zhou L","Schmitz MT","Perez Y","Mukhtar T","Robbins A","Chu J","Andrews MG","Sullivan FN","Tejera D","Choy EC","Paredes MF","Teodorescu M","Kriegstein AR","Alvarez-Buylla A","Pollen AA"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1735689600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1735689600,"objectID":"14208e2087cbbf751aea572f751e82f0","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/mostajo-radji-2025/","publishdate":"2025-12-26T05:29:39.046624Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mostajo-radji-2025/","section":"publication","summary":"Neuronal subtype generation in the mammalian central nervous system is governed by competing genetic programs. The medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) produces two major cortical interneuron (IN) populations, somatostatin (Sst) and parvalbumin (Pvalb), which develop on different timelines. The extent to which external signals influence these identities remains unclear. Pvalb-positive INs are crucial for cortical circuit regulation but challenging to model in vitro. We grafted mouse MGE progenitors into diverse 2D and 3D co-culture systems, including mouse and human cortical, MGE, and thalamic models. Strikingly, only 3D human corticogenesis models promoted efficient, non-autonomous Pvalb differentiation, characterized by upregulation of Pvalb maturation markers, downregulation of Sst-specific markers, and the formation of perineuronal nets. Additionally, lineage-traced postmitotic Sst-positive INs upregulated Pvalb when grafted onto human cortical models. These findings reveal unexpected fate plasticity in MGE-derived INs, suggesting that their identities can be dynamically shaped by the environment.","tags":null,"title":"Fate plasticity of interneuron specification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhu B","Wangzhou A","Yu D","Li T","Schmidt R","De Florencio SL","Chao L","Thurber AL","Zhou M","Msheik Z","Perez Y","Grinberg LT","Spina S","Ransohoff RM","Kriegstein AR","Seeley WW","Nowakowski T","Piao X"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1735689600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1735689600,"objectID":"d9c241e1b5857368beda7483baf7c0a5","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/zhu-2025/","publishdate":"2025-12-26T05:29:39.858157Z","relpermalink":"/publication/zhu-2025/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"G-protein-coupled receptor ADGRG1 drives a protective microglial state in Alzheimer's disease through MYC activation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wang L","Wang C","Moriano JA","Chen S","Zuo G","Cebrian-Silla A","Zhang S","Mukhtar T","Wang S","Song M","de Oliveira LG","Bi Q","Augustin JJ","Ge X","Paredes MF","Huang EJ","Alvarez-Buylla A","Duan X","Li J","Kriegstein AR"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1735689600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1735689600,"objectID":"1287d867e38176b0de468064f755ac84","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/wang-2025/","publishdate":"2025-12-26T05:29:39.035179Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wang-2025/","section":"publication","summary":"The development of the human neocortex is highly dynamic, involving complex cellular trajectories controlled by gene regulation(1).

The dynamics of LAD substructure in cells that remain postmitotic for long periods of time are poorly understood. Here, we developed Genome Organization with CUT and Tag (GO-CaT) to determine the T1- and T2-LAD substructure of postmitotic excitatory neurons isolated from the prenatal and adult human cortex. While T1-LADs exhibited epigenomic features characteristic of stable, cell type-invariant LADs including strong transcriptional repression, in prenatal neurons, T2-LADs were enriched for promoter-enhancer DNA interactions, intermediate levels of gene expression, and genetic risk associated with neurodevelopmental and cognitive disorders. In adult cortical neurons, T1-LADs were expanded in size and genomic coverage, incorporating the majority of the prenatal T2-LADs, sequestering genes involved in neurodevelopment. In contrast, the minority of prenatal T2-LADs that relocated to inter-LAD regions in adult neurons were enriched for processes related to synaptic function. Overall, these data provide evidence that LADs \\\"mature\\\" in postmitotic neurons, remodeling from a genomic architecture that is more permissive for the dynamics of transcription of development to one that is more restricted and focused on the decades-long transcriptional needs of adult brain neurons.","tags":null,"title":"Substructure and maturation of lamina-associated domains in neurons of the developing and adult human brain","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pasca SP","Arlotta P","Campbell P","Charo A","Evans JH","Farahany N","Gage FH","Godfrey-Smith P","Hyun I","Kriegstein AR","Melloni L","Ming GL","Moreno JD","Sugarman J","Temple S","Testa G","Greely HT"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1735689600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1735689600,"objectID":"50c23371a2c7adbf292752bb91a0aab6","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/pasca-2025/","publishdate":"2025-12-26T05:29:39.235264Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pasca-2025/","section":"publication","summary":"A continuing international process is needed to monitor and advise this rapidly progressing field.","tags":null,"title":"The need for a global effort to attend to human neural organoid and assembloid research","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nowakowski TJ","Nano PR","Matho KS","Chen X","Corrigan EK","Ding W","Gao Y","Heffel M","Jayakumar J","Kaplan HS","Kronman FN","Kovner R","Mannens CCA","Song M","Steyert MR","Venkatesan S","Wallace JL","Wang L","Werner JM","Zhang D","Yuan G","Zuo G","Ament SA","Colantuoni C","Dulac C","Fan R","Gillis J","Kriegstein AR","Krienen FM","Kim Y","Linnarsson S","Mitra PP","Pollen AA","Sestan N","Tward DJ","van Velthoven CTJ","Yao Z","Bhaduri A","Zeng H"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1735689600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1735689600,"objectID":"0f7ea3d456099dab1a6dd6c48beb7760","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/nowakowski-2025/","publishdate":"2025-12-26T05:29:39.170949Z","relpermalink":"/publication/nowakowski-2025/","section":"publication","summary":"Neurodevelopmental disorders that cause cognitive, behavioural or motor impairments affect around 15% of children and adolescents worldwide(1), with diagnoses of profound autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder increasing in the USA and contributing to a major economic burden(2,3).

Comprehensive cell atlases of the developing human brain, alongside those of model organisms such as mice and non-human primates, are now providing high-resolution measures of gene expression, cell-type abundance and spatial distribution. In this Perspective, we highlight recent studies that have identified novel developmental cell populations, revealed conserved and divergent patterns of cell genesis, migration and maturation across species, and begun testing hypotheses that link them to processes ranging from transcriptional control of cell fate specification to the emergence of complex behaviours. We present remaining conceptual and technical challenges and provide an outlook on how further studies of human and mammalian brain development can empower a deeper understanding of neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. Future efforts expanding to additional developmental stages, including adolescence, as well as whole-brain, multimodal and cross-species integration, will yield new insights into how development shapes the brain.

Understanding the mechanisms for this lineage switch is fundamental for unraveling how proper numbers of diverse neuronal and glial cell types are controlled. We and others recently showed that Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling promotes the cortical RGC lineage switch to generate cortical oligodendrocytes and OB interneurons. During this process, cortical RGCs generate intermediate progenitor cells that express critical gliogenesis genes Ascl1, Egfr, and Olig2. The increased Ascl1 expression and appearance of Egfr(+) and Olig2(+) cortical progenitors are concurrent with the switch from excitatory neurogenesis to gliogenesis and OB interneuron neurogenesis in the cortex. While Shh signaling promotes Olig2 expression in the developing spinal cord, the exact mechanism for this transcriptional regulation is not known. Furthermore, the transcriptional regulation of Olig2 and Egfr has not been explored. Here, we show that in cortical progenitor cells, multiple regulatory programs, including Pax6 and Gli3, prevent precocious expression of Olig2, a gene essential for production of cortical oligodendrocytes and astrocytes. We identify multiple enhancers that control Olig2 expression in cortical progenitors and show that the mechanisms for regulating Olig2 expression are conserved between the mouse and human.

This region of the brain is a highly interconnected integrative hub for sensory and spatial information; it also has a key role in episodic memory formation and is the main source of cortical hippocampal inputs(1-4). The human EC continues to develop during childhood(5), but neurogenesis and neuronal migration to the EC are widely considered to be complete by birth. Here we show that the human temporal lobe contains many young neurons migrating into the postnatal EC and adjacent regions, with a large tangential stream persisting until the age of around one year and radial dispersal continuing until around two to three years of age. By contrast, we found no equivalent postnatal migration in rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta). Immunostaining and single-nucleus RNA sequencing of ganglionic eminence germinal zones, the EC stream and the postnatal EC revealed that most migrating cells in the EC stream are derived from the caudal ganglionic eminence and become LAMP5(+)RELN(+) inhibitory interneurons. These late-arriving interneurons could continue to shape the processing of sensory and spatial information well into postnatal life, when children are actively interacting with their environment. The EC is one of the first regions of the brain to be affected in Alzheimer's disease, and previous work has linked cognitive decline to the loss of LAMP5(+)RELN(+) cells(6,7). Our investigation reveals that many of these cells arrive in the EC through a major postnatal migratory stream in early childhood.","tags":null,"title":"Protracted neuronal recruitment in the temporal lobes of young children","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ahanger SH","Zhang C","Semenza ER","Gil E","Cole MA","Wang L","Kriegstein AR","Lim DA"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1704067200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1704067200,"objectID":"aef7046ebe5d31a0a72ba3a506213ce2","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/ahanger-2024/","publishdate":"2025-12-26T05:29:39.70188Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ahanger-2024/","section":"publication","summary":"The nuclear genome is spatially organized into a three-dimensional (3D) architecture by physical association of large chromosomal domains with subnuclear compartments including the nuclear lamina at the radial periphery and nuclear speckles within the nucleoplasm(1-5). However, how spatial genome architecture regulates human brain development has been overlooked owing to technical limitations. Here, we generate high-resolution maps of genomic interactions with the lamina and speckles in cells of the neurogenic lineage isolated from midgestational human cortex, uncovering an intimate association between subnuclear genome compartmentalization, chromatin state and transcription. During cortical neurogenesis, spatial genome organization is extensively remodeled, relocating hundreds of neuronal genes from the lamina to speckles including key neurodevelopmental genes bivalent for H3K27me3 and H3K4me3. At the lamina, bivalent genes have exceptionally low expression, and relocation to speckles enhances resolution of bivalent chromatin to H3K4me3 and increases transcription \u003e7-fold. We further demonstrate that proximity to the nuclear periphery - not the presence of H3K27me3 - is the dominant factor in maintaining the lowly expressed, poised state of bivalent genes embedded in the lamina. In addition to uncovering a critical role of subnuclear genome compartmentalization in neurogenic transcriptional regulation, our results establish a new paradigm in which knowing the spatial location of a gene is necessary to understanding its epigenomic regulation.","tags":null,"title":"Spatial 3D genome organization controls the activity of bivalent chromatin during human neurogenesis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fan R","Zhang D","Rodriguez-Kirby L","Lin Y","Song M","Wang L","Wang L","Kanatani S","Jimenez-Beristain T","Dang Y","Zhong M","Kukanja P","Wang S","Chen X","Gao F","Wang D","Xu H","Lou X","Liu Y","Chen J","Sestan N","Uhlen P","Kriegstein AR","Zhao H","Castelo-Branco G"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1704067200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1704067200,"objectID":"1ee615a1aeca951dc98414a4dffecd1a","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/fan-2024/","publishdate":"2025-12-26T05:29:39.126713Z","relpermalink":"/publication/fan-2024/","section":"publication","summary":"The ability to spatially map multiple layers of the omics information over different time points allows for exploring the mechanisms driving brain development, differentiation, arealization, and alterations in disease.

However, it remains unknown whether BMP dysfunction has direct contribution to debilitating pain reported in many of these disorders. Here, we identified a novel neuropathic pain phenotype in patients with fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP), a rare autosomal-dominant musculoskeletal disorder characterized by progressive heterotopic ossification. Ninety-seven percent of these patients carry an R206H gain-of-function point mutation in the BMP type I receptor ACVR1 (ACVR1 R206H ), which causes neofunction to Activin A and constitutively activates signaling through phosphorylated SMAD1/5/8. Although patients with FOP can harbor pathological lesions in the peripheral and central nervous system, their etiology and clinical impact are unclear. Quantitative sensory testing of patients with FOP revealed significant heat and mechanical pain hypersensitivity. Although there was no major effect of ACVR1 R206H on differentiation and maturation of nociceptive sensory neurons (iSNs) derived from FOP induced pluripotent stem cells, both intracellular and extracellular electrophysiology analyses of the ACVR1 R206H iSNs displayed ACVR1-dependent hyperexcitability, a hallmark of neuropathic pain. Consistent with this phenotype, we recorded enhanced responses of ACVR1 R206H iSNs to TRPV1 and TRPA1 agonists. Thus, activated ACVR1 signaling can modulate pain processing in humans and may represent a potential target for pain management in FOP and related BMP pathway diseases.","tags":null,"title":"ACVR1-activating mutation causes neuropathic pain and sensory neuron hyperexcitability in humans","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marsan E","Velmeshev D","Ramsey A","Patel RK","Zhang J","Koontz M","Andrews MG","de Majo M","Mora C","Blumenfeld J","Li AN","Spina S","Grinberg LT","Seeley WW","Miller BL","Ullian EM","Krummel MF","Kriegstein AR","Huang EJ"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672531200,"objectID":"d08154eac9252ef6c5ac073c9d6ba199","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/marsan-2023/","publishdate":"2025-12-26T05:29:39.116466Z","relpermalink":"/publication/marsan-2023/","section":"publication","summary":"Mutations in the human progranulin (GRN) gene are a leading cause of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD).

By performing comparative single-cell transcriptomics in the thalamus and frontal cortex of Grn-/- mice and patients with FTLD-GRN, we have uncovered a highly conserved astroglial pathology characterized by upregulation of gap junction protein GJA1, water channel AQP4, and lipid-binding protein APOE, and downregulation of glutamate transporter SLC1A2 that promoted profound synaptic degeneration across the two species. This astroglial toxicity could be recapitulated in mouse astrocyte-neuron cocultures and by transplanting induced pluripotent stem cell-derived astrocytes to cortical organoids, where progranulin-deficient astrocytes promoted synaptic degeneration, neuronal stress, and TDP-43 proteinopathy.

ZIKV infection disrupted the organization of centrosomal proteins including CEP63, a MCPH-associated protein. The ZIKV nonstructural protein NS3 bound CEP63, and expression of NS3 was sufficient to alter centrosome architecture and CEP63 localization. Loss of CEP63 suppressed ZIKV-induced centrosome disorganization, indicating that ZIKV requires CEP63 to disrupt centrosome organization. ZIKV infection or CEP63 loss decreased the centrosomal localization and stability of TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), a regulator of the innate immune response. ZIKV infection also increased the centrosomal accumulation of the CEP63 interactor DTX4, a ubiquitin ligase that degrades TBK1.

Lamina-associated domain (LAD) architecture in cells in vivo is distinct from that of cultured cells, including major differences in LADs previously considered to be cell type invariant. In the mouse and human forebrain, dorsal and ventral neural precursor cells have differences in LAD architecture that correspond to their regional identity. LADs in the human and mouse cortex contain transcriptionally highly active sub-domains characterized by broad depletion of histone-3-lysine-9 dimethylation. Evolutionarily conserved LADs in human, macaque and mouse brain are enriched for transcriptionally active neural genes associated with synapse function. By integrating GO-CaRT maps with genome-wide association study data, we found speckle-associated domains to be enriched for schizophrenia risk loci, indicating a physical relationship between these disease-associated genetic variants and a specific nuclear structure.

The potential diversity of the nIPC population, that produces a significant portion of excitatory cortical neurons, is understudied, particularly in the developing human brain. Here we explore the spatiotemporal, transcriptomic, and morphological variation that exists within the human nIPC population and provide a resource for future studies. We observe that the spatial distribution of nIPCs in the cortex changes abruptly around gestational week (GW) 19/20, marking a distinct shift in cellular distribution and organization during late neurogenesis. We also identify five transcriptomic subtypes, one of which appears at this spatiotemporal transition. Finally, we observe a diversity of nIPC morphologies that do not correlate with specific transcriptomic subtypes. These results provide an analysis of the spatiotemporal, transcriptional, and morphological diversity of nIPCs in developing brain tissue and provide an atlas of nIPC subtypes in the developing human cortex that can benchmark in vitro models of human development such as cerebral organoids and help inform future studies of how nIPCs contribute to cortical neurogenesis.","tags":null,"title":"Human intermediate progenitor diversity during cortical development","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bhaduri A","Neumann EK","Kriegstein AR","Sweedler JV"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609459200,"objectID":"38657b9b6d19834963d320e1c70f999b","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/bhaduri-2021/","publishdate":"2025-12-26T05:29:39.490261Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bhaduri-2021/","section":"publication","summary":"The lipidome is currently understudied but fundamental to life.

Here we characterize cell-type-specific cis-regulatory chromatin interactions, open chromatin peaks, and transcriptomes for radial glia, intermediate progenitor cells, excitatory neurons, and interneurons isolated from mid-gestational samples of the human cortex. We show that chromatin interactions underlie several aspects of gene regulation, with transposable elements and disease-associated variants enriched at distal interacting regions in a cell-type-specific manner. In addition, promoters with increased levels of chromatin interactivity-termed super-interactive promoters-are enriched for lineage-specific genes, suggesting that interactions at these loci contribute to the fine-tuning of transcription. Finally, we develop CRISPRview, a technique that integrates immunostaining, CRISPR interference, RNAscope, and image analysis to validate cell-type-specific cis-regulatory elements in heterogeneous populations of primary cells.

Herein, we provide evidence for the molecular mechanism that underlies this switch in the state of neocortical NSCs. We show that, at around E16.5, mouse neocortical NSCs start to generate GSX2-expressing (GSX2(+)) intermediate progenitor cells (IPCs). In vivo lineage-tracing study revealed that GSX2(+) IPC population gives rise not only to OB interneurons but also to cortical oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, suggesting that they are a tri-potential population. We demonstrated that Sonic hedgehog signaling is both necessary and sufficient for the generation of GSX2(+) IPCs by reducing GLI3R protein levels.

ASD is characterized by social deficits and a range of other phenotypes, implicating complex genetics and involvement of a variety of brain regions. However, how mutations and mis-expression of select gene sets are associated with the behavioral components of ASD remains unknown. We reasoned that for genes to be associated with ASD core behaviors they must be: (1) expressed in brain regions relevant to ASD social behaviors and (2) expressed during the ASD susceptible window of brain development. METHODS: Focusing on the amygdala, a brain region whose dysfunction has been highly implicated in the social component of ASD, we mined publicly available gene expression databases to identify ASD-susceptibility genes expressed during human and mouse amygdala development. We found that a large cohort of known ASD susceptibility genes is expressed in the developing human and mouse amygdala. We further performed analysis of single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) data from microdissected amygdala tissue from five ASD and five control human postmortem brains ranging in age from 4 to 20 years to elucidate cell type specificity of amygdala-expressed genes and their dysregulation in ASD. RESULTS: Our analyses revealed that of the high-ranking ASD susceptibility genes, 80 are expressed in both human and mouse amygdala during fetal to early postnatal stages of development. Our human snRNA-seq analyses revealed cohorts of genes with altered expression in the ASD amygdala postnatally, especially within excitatory neurons, with dysregulated expression of seven genes predicted from our datamining pipeline. LIMITATIONS: We were limited by the ages for which we were able to obtain human tissue; therefore, the results from our datamining pipeline approach will require validation, to the extent possible, in human tissue from earlier developmental stages. CONCLUSIONS: Our pipeline narrows down the number of amygdala-expressed genes possibly involved in the social pathophysiology of ASD. Our human single-nucleus gene expression analyses revealed that ASD is characterized by changes in gene expression in specific cell types in the early postnatal amygdala.","tags":null,"title":"Identification of amygdala-expressed genes associated with autism spectrum disorder","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Selvadurai HJ","Luis E","Desai K","Lan X","Vladoiu MC","Whitley O","Galvin C","Vanner RJ","Lee L","Whetstone H","Kushida M","Nowakowski T","Diamandis P","Hawkins C","Bader G","Kriegstein A","Taylor MD","Dirks PB"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"6ccb4a7e5f98047eaecdcd4099042091","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/selvadurai-2020/","publishdate":"2025-12-26T05:29:39.520864Z","relpermalink":"/publication/selvadurai-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"Medulloblastoma (MB) is a neoplasm linked to dysregulated cerebellar development. Previously, we demonstrated that the Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) subgroup grows hierarchically, with Sox2(+) cells at the apex of tumor progression and relapse. To test whether this mechanism is rooted in a normal developmental process, we studied the role of Sox2 in cerebellar development. We find that the external germinal layer (EGL) is derived from embryonic Sox2(+) precursors and that the EGL maintains a rare fraction of Sox2(+) cells during the first postnatal week. Through lineage tracing and single-cell analysis, we demonstrate that these Sox2(+) cells are within the Atoh1(+) lineage, contribute extensively to adult granule neurons, and resemble Sox2(+) tumor cells. Critically, constitutive activation of the SHH pathway leads to their aberrant persistence in the EGL and rapid tumor onset.

We find that dysregulation of mTOR signaling specifically affects oRG cells, but not other progenitor types, by changing the actin cytoskeleton through the activity of the Rho-GTPase, CDC42. These effects change oRG cellular morphology, migration, and mitotic behavior, but do not affect proliferation or cell fate. Thus, mTOR signaling can regulate the architecture of the developing human cortex by maintaining the cytoskeletal organization of oRG cells and the radial glia scaffold.

Rodent models are extremely valuable for the investigation of brain development, but cannot provide insight into aspects that are unique or highly derived in humans. Many human psychiatric and neurological conditions have developmental origins but cannot be studied adequately in animal models. The human cerebral cortex has some unique genetic, molecular, cellular and anatomical features, which need to be further explored. The Anatomical Society devoted its summer meeting to the topic of Human Brain Development in June 2018 to tackle these important issues. The meeting was organized by Gavin Clowry (Newcastle University) and Zoltan Molnar (University of Oxford), and held at St John's College, Oxford. The participants provided a broad overview of the structure of the human brain in the context of scaling relationships across the brains of mammals, conserved principles and recent changes in the human lineage. Speakers considered how neuronal progenitors diversified in human to generate an increasing variety of cortical neurons. The formation of the earliest cortical circuits of the earliest generated neurons in the subplate was discussed together with their involvement in neurodevelopmental pathologies. Gene expression networks and susceptibility genes associated to neurodevelopmental diseases were discussed and compared with the networks that can be identified in organoids developed from induced pluripotent stem cells that recapitulate some aspects of in vivo development. New views were discussed on the specification of glutamatergic pyramidal and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic interneurons. With the advancement of various in vivo imaging methods, the histopathological observations can be now linked to in vivo normal conditions and to various diseases. Our review gives a general evaluation of the exciting new developments in these areas. The human cortex has a much enlarged association cortex with greater interconnectivity of cortical areas with each other and with an expanded thalamus. The human cortex has relative enlargement of the upper layers, enhanced diversity and function of inhibitory interneurons and a highly expanded transient subplate layer during development. Here we highlight recent studies that address how these differences emerge during development focusing on diverse facets of our evolution.","tags":null,"title":"New insights into the development of the human cerebral cortex","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nobuta H","Yang N","Ng YH","Marro SG","Sabeur K","Chavali M","Stockley JH","Killilea DW","Walter PB","Zhao C","Huie P Jr","Goldman SA","Kriegstein AR","Franklin RJM","Rowitch DH","Wernig M"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"5039e1afd663bd08ff1813d09016743f","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/nobuta-2019/","publishdate":"2025-12-26T05:29:39.468633Z","relpermalink":"/publication/nobuta-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD) is an X-linked leukodystrophy caused by mutations in Proteolipid Protein 1 (PLP1), encoding a major myelin protein, resulting in profound developmental delay and early lethality.

It is unclear whether mesenchymal GSCs (mGSC) and/or proneural GSCs (pGSC) alone are sufficient to generate the heterogeneity observed in GBM. We performed single-cell/single-nucleus RNA sequencing of 28 gliomas, and single-cell ATAC sequencing for 8 cases. We found that GBM GSCs reside on a single axis of variation, ranging from proneural to mesenchymal. In silico lineage tracing using both transcriptomics and genetics supports mGSCs as the progenitors of pGSCs. Dual inhibition of pGSC-enriched and mGSC-enriched growth and survival pathways provides a more complete treatment than combinations targeting one GSC phenotype alone. This study sheds light on a long-standing debate regarding lineage relationships among GSCs and presents a paradigm by which personalized combination therapies can be derived from single-cell RNA signatures, to overcome intratumor heterogeneity. SIGNIFICANCE: Tumor-propagating cells can be derived from mesenchymal and proneural glioblastomas. However, a stem cell of the classic subtype has yet to be demonstrated. We show that classic-subtype gliomas are comprised of proneural and mesenchymal cells.

Integrating genomic annotations at the level of nucleotides, genes, and regulatory regions, we define 51,801 annotation categories. Analyses of 519 autism spectrum disorder families did not identify association with any categories after correction for 4,123 effective tests. Without appropriate correction, biologically plausible associations are observed in both cases and controls. Despite excluding previously identified gene-disrupting mutations, coding regions still exhibited the strongest associations. Thus, in autism, the contribution of de novo noncoding variation is probably modest in comparison to that of de novo coding variants.

This process has been linked to learning and memory, stress and exercise, and is thought to be altered in neurological disease. In humans, some studies have suggested that hundreds of new neurons are added to the adult dentate gyrus every day, whereas other studies find many fewer putative new neurons. Despite these discrepancies, it is generally believed that the adult human hippocampus continues to generate new neurons. Here we show that a defined population of progenitor cells does not coalesce in the subgranular zone during human fetal or postnatal development. We also find that the number of proliferating progenitors and young neurons in the dentate gyrus declines sharply during the first year of life and only a few isolated young neurons are observed by 7 and 13 years of age. In adult patients with epilepsy and healthy adults (18-77 years; n = 17 post-mortem samples from controls; n = 12 surgical resection samples from patients with epilepsy), young neurons were not detected in the dentate gyrus. In the monkey (Macaca mulatta) hippocampus, proliferation of neurons in the subgranular zone was found in early postnatal life, but this diminished during juvenile development as neurogenesis decreased. We conclude that recruitment of young neurons to the primate hippocampus decreases rapidly during the first years of life, and that neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus does not continue, or is extremely rare, in adult humans. The early decline in hippocampal neurogenesis raises questions about how the function of the dentate gyrus differs between humans and other species in which adult hippocampal neurogenesis is preserved.","tags":null,"title":"Human hippocampal neurogenesis drops sharply in children to undetectable levels in adults","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fiddes IT","Lodewijk GA","Mooring M","Bosworth CM","Ewing AD","Mantalas GL","Novak AM","van den Bout A","Bishara A","Rosenkrantz JL","Lorig-Roach R","Field AR","Haeussler M","Russo L","Bhaduri A","Nowakowski TJ","Pollen AA","Dougherty ML","Nuttle X","Addor MC","Zwolinski S","Katzman S","Kriegstein A","Eichler EE","Salama SR","Jacobs FMJ","Haussler D"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"ff2eb0d9dc6d6ab309d9a03728a27926","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/fiddes-2018/","publishdate":"2025-12-26T05:29:38.958309Z","relpermalink":"/publication/fiddes-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"Genetic changes causing brain size expansion in human evolution have remained elusive. Notch signaling is essential for radial glia stem cell proliferation and is a determinant of neuronal number in the mammalian cortex. We find that three paralogs of human-specific NOTCH2NL are highly expressed in radial glia. Functional analysis reveals that different alleles of NOTCH2NL have varying potencies to enhance Notch signaling by interacting directly with NOTCH receptors. Consistent with a role in Notch signaling, NOTCH2NL ectopic expression delays differentiation of neuronal progenitors, while deletion accelerates differentiation into cortical neurons. Furthermore, NOTCH2NL genes provide the breakpoints in 1q21.1 distal deletion/duplication syndrome, where duplications are associated with macrocephaly and autism and deletions with microcephaly and schizophrenia. Thus, the emergence of human-specific NOTCH2NL genes may have contributed to the rapid evolution of the larger human neocortex, accompanied by loss of genomic stability at the 1q21.1 locus and resulting recurrent neurodevelopmental disorders.","tags":null,"title":"Human-Specific NOTCH2NL Genes Affect Notch Signaling and Cortical Neurogenesis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bhaduri A","Nowakowski TJ","Pollen AA","Kriegstein AR"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"17adb9198d0f69e47c5dd7b513d2be3f","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/bhaduri-2018/","publishdate":"2025-12-26T05:29:39.586252Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bhaduri-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"BACKGROUND: High throughput methods for profiling the transcriptomes of single cells have recently emerged as transformative approaches for large-scale population surveys of cellular diversity in heterogeneous primary tissues. However, the efficient generation of such atlases will depend on sufficient sampling of diverse cell types while remaining cost-effective to enable a comprehensive examination of organs, developmental stages, and individuals. RESULTS: To examine the relationship between sampled cell numbers and transcriptional heterogeneity in the context of unbiased cell type classification, we explored the population structure of a publicly available 1.3 million cell dataset from E18.5 mouse brain and validated our findings in published data from adult mice. We propose a computational framework for inferring the saturation point of cluster discovery in a single-cell mRNA-seq experiment, centered around cluster preservation in downsampled datasets. In addition, we introduce a \\\"complexity index,\\\" which characterizes the heterogeneity of cells in a given dataset. Using Cajal-Retzius cells as an example of a limited complexity dataset, we explored whether the detected biological distinctions relate to technical clustering. Surprisingly, we found that clustering distinctions carrying biologically interpretable meaning are achieved with far fewer cells than the originally sampled, though technical saturation of rare populations such as Cajal-Retzius cells is not achieved. We additionally validated these findings with a recently published atlas of cell types across mouse organs and again find using subsampling that a much smaller number of cells recapitulates the cluster distinctions of the complete dataset. CONCLUSIONS: Together, these findings suggest that most of the biologically interpretable cell types from the 1.3 million cell database can be recapitulated by analyzing 50,000 randomly selected cells, indicating that instead of profiling few individuals at high \\\"cellular coverage,\\\" cell atlas studies may instead benefit from profiling more individuals, or many time points at lower cellular coverage and then further enriching for populations of interest. This strategy is ideal for scenarios where cost and time are limited, though extremely rare populations of interest (\u003c 1%) may be identifiable only with much higher cell numbers.","tags":null,"title":"Identification of cell types in a mouse brain single-cell atlas using low sampling coverage","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nowakowski TJ","Rani N","Golkaram M","Zhou HR","Alvarado B","Huch K","West JA","Leyrat A","Pollen AA","Kriegstein AR","Petzold LR","Kosik KS"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"e44cc3ad881667bdc3ad932cc03d077d","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/nowakowski-2018/","publishdate":"2025-12-26T05:29:39.434685Z","relpermalink":"/publication/nowakowski-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate many cellular events during brain development by interacting with hundreds of mRNA transcripts.

By combining multiple complementary approaches, high-throughput sequencing of RNA isolated by cross-linking immunoprecipitation with an antibody to AGO2 (AGO2-HITS-CLIP), single-cell profiling and computational analyses using bipartite and coexpression networks, we show that miRNA-mRNA interactions operate as functional modules that often correspond to cell-type identities and undergo dynamic transitions during brain development.

It is unknown to what extent macrophages derived from peripheral blood adopt the phenotype of brain-resident microglia in pre-treatment gliomas. The relative proportions of blood-derived macrophages and microglia have been poorly quantified in clinical samples due to a paucity of markers that distinguish these cell types in malignant tissue. RESULTS: We perform single-cell RNA-sequencing of human gliomas and identify phenotypic differences in TAMs of distinct lineages. We isolate TAMs from patient biopsies and compare them with macrophages from non-malignant human tissue, glioma atlases, and murine glioma models. We present a novel signature that distinguishes TAMs by ontogeny in human gliomas. Blood-derived TAMs upregulate immunosuppressive cytokines and show an altered metabolism compared to microglial TAMs. They are also enriched in perivascular and necrotic regions. The gene signature of blood-derived TAMs, but not microglial TAMs, correlates with significantly inferior survival in low-grade glioma. Surprisingly, TAMs frequently co-express canonical pro-inflammatory (M1) and alternatively activated (M2) genes in individual cells. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that blood-derived TAMs significantly infiltrate pre-treatment gliomas, to a degree that varies by glioma subtype and tumor compartment. Blood-derived TAMs do not universally conform to the phenotype of microglia, but preferentially express immunosuppressive cytokines and show an altered metabolism. Our results argue against status quo therapeutic strategies that target TAMs indiscriminately and in favor of strategies that specifically target immunosuppressive blood-derived TAMs.","tags":null,"title":"Single-cell profiling of human gliomas reveals macrophage ontogeny as a basis for regional differences in macrophage activation in the tumor microenvironment","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nowakowski TJ","Bhaduri A","Pollen AA","Alvarado B","Mostajo-Radji MA","Di Lullo E","Haeussler M","Sandoval-Espinosa C","Liu SJ","Velmeshev D","Ounadjela JR","Shuga J","Wang X","Lim DA","West JA","Leyrat AA","Kent WJ","Kriegstein AR"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"932c0127d8e12fa9b8bf9b37b105f61e","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/nowakowski-2017/","publishdate":"2025-12-26T05:29:38.913137Z","relpermalink":"/publication/nowakowski-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"Systematic analyses of spatiotemporal gene expression trajectories during organogenesis have been challenging because diverse cell types at different stages of maturation and differentiation coexist in the emerging tissues.

LncRNAs exhibit cell type- and tissue-specific expression, but little is known about the expression and function of lncRNAs in the developing human brain. Furthermore, it has been unclear whether lncRNAs are highly expressed in subsets of cells within tissues, despite appearing lowly expressed in bulk populations. RESULTS: We use strand-specific RNA-seq to deeply profile lncRNAs from polyadenylated and total RNA obtained from human neocortex at different stages of development, and we apply this reference to analyze the transcriptomes of single cells. While lncRNAs are generally detected at low levels in bulk tissues, single-cell transcriptomics of hundreds of neocortex cells reveal that many lncRNAs are abundantly expressed in individual cells and are cell type-specific. Notably, LOC646329 is a lncRNA enriched in single radial glia cells but is detected at low abundance in tissues. CRISPRi knockdown of LOC646329 indicates that this lncRNA regulates cell proliferation.

In contrast, phylogenetic analysis of an EGFR-amplified tumor showed an up-regulation of pro-invasive genes.

We identify the brain cell populations that are most susceptible to ZIKV infection in primary human tissue, provide evidence for a mechanism of viral entry, and show that a commonly used antibiotic protects cultured brain cells by reducing viral proliferation. In the brain, ZIKV preferentially infected neural stem cells, astrocytes, oligodendrocyte precursor cells, and microglia, whereas neurons were less susceptible to infection. These findings suggest mechanisms for microcephaly and other pathologic features of infants with congenital ZIKV infection that are not explained by neural stem cell infection alone, such as calcifications in the cortical plate. Furthermore, we find that blocking the glia-enriched putative viral entry receptor AXL reduced ZIKV infection of astrocytes in vitro, and genetic knockdown of AXL in a glial cell line nearly abolished infection. Finally, we evaluate 2,177 compounds, focusing on drugs safe in pregnancy.

In the lissencephalic rodent brain, pyramidal neurons are born in the ventricular and subventricular zones of the pallium and migrate along radial glia fibers to reach the appropriate cortical layer. Although much less is known about neuronal migration in species with a gyrencephalic cortex, retroviral studies in the ferret and primate suggest that, unlike the rodent, pyramidal neurons do not follow strict radial pathways and instead can disperse horizontally. However, the means by which pyramidal neurons laterally disperse remain unknown. In this study, we identified a viral labeling technique for visualizing neuronal migration in the ferret, a gyrencephalic carnivore, and found that migration was predominantly radial at early postnatal ages. In contrast, neurons displayed more tortuous migration routes with a decreased frequency of cortical plate-directed migration at later stages of neurogenesis concomitant with the start of brain folding. This was accompanied by neurons migrating sequentially along several different radial glial fibers, suggesting a mode by which pyramidal neurons may laterally disperse in a folded cortex. These findings provide insight into the migratory behavior of neurons in gyrencephalic species and provide a framework for using nonrodent model systems for studying neuronal migration disorders. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Elucidating neuronal migration dynamics in the gyrencephalic, or folded, cortex is important for understanding neurodevelopmental disorders. Similar to the rodent, we found that neuronal migration was predominantly radial at early postnatal ages in the gyrencephalic ferret cortex. Interestingly, ferret neurons displayed more tortuous migration routes and a decreased frequency of radial migration at later ages coincident with the start of cortical folding. We found that ferret neurons use several different radial glial fibers as migratory guides, including those belonging to the recently described outer radial glia, suggesting a mechanism by which ferret neurons disperse laterally. It is likely that excitatory neurons horizontally disperse in other gyrencephalic mammals, including the primate, suggesting an important modification to the current model deduced primarily from the rodent.","tags":null,"title":"Neuronal Migration Dynamics in the Developing Ferret Cortex","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ramos AD","Andersen RE","Liu SJ","Nowakowski TJ","Hong SJ","Gertz C","Salinas RD","Zarabi H","Kriegstein AR","Lim DA"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"d5519fb46c3498d8466d6ab8bca11fa8","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/ramos-2015/","publishdate":"2025-12-26T05:29:39.653603Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ramos-2015/","section":"publication","summary":"While thousands of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been identified, few lncRNAs that control neural stem cell (NSC) behavior are known.

In postnatal NSCs, Pnky knockdown potentiates neuronal lineage commitment and expands the transit-amplifying cell population, increasing neuron production several-fold. Pnky is evolutionarily conserved and expressed in NSCs of the developing human brain. In the embryonic mouse cortex, Pnky knockdown increases neuronal differentiation and depletes the NSC population. Pnky interacts with the splicing regulator PTBP1, and PTBP1 knockdown also enhances neurogenesis. In NSCs, Pnky and PTBP1 regulate the expression and alternative splicing of a core set of transcripts that relates to the cellular phenotype.

Rings form after fusion of the long and short arms of a chromosome, and are sometimes associated with large terminal deletions. Owing to the severity of these large aberrations that can affect multiple contiguous genes, no possible therapeutic strategies for ring chromosome disorders have been proposed. During cell division, ring chromosomes can exhibit unstable behaviour leading to continuous production of aneuploid progeny with low viability and high cellular death rate. The overall consequences of this chromosomal instability have been largely unexplored in experimental model systems. Here we generated human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from patient fibroblasts containing ring chromosomes with large deletions and found that reprogrammed cells lost the abnormal chromosome and duplicated the wild-type homologue through the compensatory uniparental disomy (UPD) mechanism. The karyotypically normal iPSCs with isodisomy for the corrected chromosome outgrew co-existing aneuploid populations, enabling rapid and efficient isolation of patient-derived iPSCs devoid of the original chromosomal aberration. Our results suggest a fundamentally different function for cellular reprogramming as a means of 'chromosome therapy' to reverse combined loss-of-function across many genes in cells with large-scale aberrations involving ring structures. In addition, our work provides an experimentally tractable human cellular system for studying mechanisms of chromosomal number control, which is of critical relevance to human development and disease.","tags":null,"title":"Cell-autonomous correction of ring chromosomes in human induced pluripotent stem cells","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ostrem BE","Lui JH","Gertz CC","Kriegstein AR"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388534400,"objectID":"97cf1d93f45020d0b145536fca33ae83","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/ostrem-2014/","publishdate":"2025-12-26T05:29:39.560116Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ostrem-2014/","section":"publication","summary":"Evolutionary expansion of the human neocortex is partially attributed to a relative abundance of neural stem cells in the fetal brain called outer radial glia (oRG). oRG cells display a characteristic division mode, mitotic somal translocation (MST), in which the soma rapidly translocates toward the cortical plate immediately prior to cytokinesis.

In the adult turtle, we show that RG cells encompass a morphologically heterogeneous population, particularly in the subpallium where proliferation is most prevalent.

Here we show that the transcriptional profiles of human and mouse neocortical RG are broadly conserved during neurogenesis, yet diverge for specific signalling pathways. By analysing differential gene co-expression relationships between the species, we demonstrate that the growth factor PDGFD is specifically expressed by RG in human, but not mouse, corticogenesis. We also show that the expression domain of PDGFRbeta, the cognate receptor for PDGFD, is evolutionarily divergent, with high expression in the germinal region of dorsal human neocortex but not in the mouse. Pharmacological inhibition of PDGFD-PDGFRbeta signalling in slice culture prevents normal cell cycle progression of neocortical RG in human, but not mouse. Conversely, injection of recombinant PDGFD or ectopic expression of constitutively active PDGFRbeta in developing mouse neocortex increases the proportion of RG and their subventricular dispersion.

In contrast, the neurogenic competence of Ink4a/Arf-deficient astroglia is both greatly increased and does not diminish through serial cell culture passage. Electrophysiological analysis further demonstrates the neuronal identity of cells induced from Ink4a/Arf-null astroglia, and short hairpin RNA-mediated acute knockdown of p16Ink4a and p19Arf p16(Ink4a) and p19(Arf) indicates that these gene products function postnatally as a barrier to cellular transdifferentiation. Finally, we found that mouse fibroblasts deficient for Ink4a/Arf also exhibit greatly enhanced transcription factor-induced neuronal induction.

During development, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in adults, typically excites neurons due to high expression of the Na(+)-K(+)-2Cl(-) cotransporter (NKCC1). NKCC1 facilitates seizures because it renders GABA activity excitatory through intracellular Cl(-) accumulation, while blocking NKCC1 with bumetanide suppresses seizures. Bumetanide is currently being tested in clinical trials for treatment of neonatal seizures. By blocking NKCC1 with bumetanide during cortical development, we found a critical period for the development of alpha-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionate synapses. Disruption of GABA signaling during this window resulted in permanent decreases in excitatory synaptic transmission and sensorimotor gating deficits, a common feature in schizophrenia. Our study identifies an essential role for GABA-mediated depolarization in regulating the balance between cortical excitation and inhibition during a critical period and suggests a cautionary approach for using bumetanide in treating neonatal seizures.","tags":null,"title":"Blocking early GABA depolarization with bumetanide results in permanent alterations in cortical circuits and sensorimotor gating deficits","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hansen DV","Rubenstein JL","Kriegstein AR"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1293840000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1293840000,"objectID":"0c9ea14d53ec1cccd33d489f2cce03dd","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/hansen-2011/","publishdate":"2025-12-26T05:29:39.272534Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hansen-2011/","section":"publication","summary":"The human cerebral cortex is an immensely complex structure that subserves critical functions that can be disrupted in developmental and degenerative disorders.

Excitatory pyramidal neurons originate near the ventricle and migrate radially to their position in the cortical plate along radial glial fibers. On the other hand, inhibitory interneurons arise in the ventral telencephalon and migrate tangentially to enter the developing cortex before migrating radially to reach their correct laminar position. Gap junction adhesion has been shown to play an important mechanistic role in the radial migration of excitatory neurons. We asked whether a similar mechanism governs the tangential or radial migration of inhibitory interneurons. Using short hairpin RNA knockdown of Connexin 43 (Cx43) and Cx26 together with rescue experiments, we found that gap junctions are dispensable for the tangential migration of interneurons, but that Cx43 plays a role in the switch from tangential to radial migration that allows interneurons to enter the cortical plate and find their correct laminar position. Moreover this action is dependent on the adhesive properties and the C terminus of Cx43 but not the Cx43 channel. Thus, the radial phase of interneuron migration resembles that of excitatory neuron migration in terms of dependence on Cx43 adhesion. Furthermore, gap junctions between migrating interneurons and radial processes were observed by electron microscopy. These findings provide mechanistic and structural support for a gap junction-mediated interaction between migrating interneurons and radial glia during the switch from tangential to radial migration.","tags":null,"title":"Connexin 43 mediates the tangential to radial migratory switch in ventrally derived cortical interneurons","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rowitch DH","Kriegstein AR"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1262304000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1262304000,"objectID":"4e63157e31d12739c6d1a666c9bf0a27","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/rowitch-2010/","publishdate":"2025-12-26T05:29:39.202533Z","relpermalink":"/publication/rowitch-2010/","section":"publication","summary":"Oligodendrocytes and astrocytes are macroglial cells of the vertebrate central nervous system.

In Drosophila, cleavage plane orientation dictates the inheritance of fate-determinants and the symmetry of newborn daughter cells during neuroblast cell divisions. One model for predicting daughter cell fate in the mammalian neocortex is also based on cleavage plane orientation. Precursor cell divisions with a cleavage plane orientation that is perpendicular with respect to the ventricular surface (vertical) are predicted to be symmetric, while divisions with a cleavage plane orientation that is parallel to the surface (horizontal) are predicted to be asymmetric neurogenic divisions. However, analysis of cleavage plane orientation at the ventricle suggests that the number of predicted neurogenic divisions might be insufficient to produce large amounts of cortical neurons. To understand factors that correlate with the symmetry of cell divisions, we examined rat neocortical precursor cells in situ through real-time imaging, marker analysis, and electrophysiological recordings. We find that cleavage plane orientation is more closely associated with precursor cell type than with daughter cell fate, as commonly thought. Radial glia cells in the VZ primarily divide with a vertical orientation throughout cortical development and undergo symmetric or asymmetric self-renewing divisions depending on the stage of development. In contrast, most intermediate progenitor cells divide in the subventricular zone with a horizontal orientation and produce symmetric daughter cells. We propose a model for predicting daughter cell fate that considers precursor cell type, stage of development, and the planar segregation of fate determinants.","tags":null,"title":"Distinct behaviors of neural stem and progenitor cells underlie cortical neurogenesis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wang DD","Kriegstein AR"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1199145600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1199145600,"objectID":"eccd9dff0773f454303462be172925b2","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/wang-2008/","publishdate":"2025-12-26T05:29:39.744261Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wang-2008/","section":"publication","summary":"The development of a balance between excitatory and inhibitory synapses is a critical process in the generation and maturation of functional circuits. Accumulating evidence suggests that neuronal activity plays an important role in achieving such a balance in the developing cortex, but the mechanism that regulates this process is unknown. During development, GABA, the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in adults, excites neurons as a result of high expression of the Na(+)-K(+)-2Cl(-) cotransporter (NKCC1). Using NKCC1 RNA interference knockdown in vivo, we show that GABA-induced depolarization is necessary for proper excitatory synapse formation and dendritic development of newborn cortical neurons. Blocking NKCC1 with the diuretic bumetanide during development leads to similar persistent changes in cortical circuitry in the adult. Interestingly, expression of a voltage-independent NMDA receptor rescues the failure of NKCC1 knockdown neurons to develop excitatory AMPA transmission, indicating that GABA depolarization cooperates with NMDA receptor activation to regulate excitatory synapse formation. Our study identifies an essential role for GABA in the synaptic integration of newborn cortical neurons and suggests an activity-dependent mechanism for achieving the balance between excitation and inhibition in the developing cortex.","tags":null,"title":"GABA regulates excitatory synapse formation in the neocortex via NMDA receptor activation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Elias LA","Kriegstein AR"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1199145600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1199145600,"objectID":"779e74497e1987eee285ec8480fe6bc9","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/elias-2008/","publishdate":"2025-12-26T05:29:39.879147Z","relpermalink":"/publication/elias-2008/","section":"publication","summary":"The morphological development of the cerebral cortex from a primitive neuroepithelium into a complex laminar structure underlying higher cognition must rely on a network of intercellular signaling.

Furthermore, we provide evidence that radial glial cells maintain a vimentin-positive radial fiber throughout each stage of cell division. Asymmetric inheritance of this fiber may be an important factor in determining how neuronal progeny will migrate into the developing cortical plate. Although radial glial cells have traditionally been characterized by their role in guiding migration, their role as neuronal progenitors may represent their defining characteristic throughout the vertebrate CNS.","tags":null,"title":"Neurogenic radial glial cells in reptile, rodent and human: from mitosis to migration","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fishell G","Kriegstein AR"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1041379200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1041379200,"objectID":"e87c034778ab5629bac9855ef60a5337","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/fishell-2003/","publishdate":"2025-12-26T05:29:39.319123Z","relpermalink":"/publication/fishell-2003/","section":"publication","summary":"Recent work suggests that radial glial cells represent many, if not most, of the neuronal progenitors in the developing cortex. Asymmetric cell division of radial glia results in the self-renewal of the radial glial cell and the birth of a neuron. Among the proteins that direct cell fate in Drosophila melanogaster that have known mammalian homologs, Numb is the best candidate to have a similar function in radial glia. During asymmetric divisions of radial glial cells, the basal cell may inherit the radial glial fibre, while the apical cell sequesters the majority of the Numb protein. We suggest two models that make opposite predictions as to whether the radial glia or nascent neuron inherit the radial glial fiber or the majority of the Numb protein.","tags":null,"title":"Neurons from radial glia: the consequences of asymmetric inheritance","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kriegstein AR","Gotz M"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1041379200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1041379200,"objectID":"d97244d7cfdb5779b25039969effb0e1","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/kriegstein-2003/","publishdate":"2025-12-26T05:29:39.335257Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kriegstein-2003/","section":"publication","summary":"Early in development of the central nervous system, radial glial cells arise from the neuroepithelial cells lining the ventricles around the time that neurons begin to appear. The transition of neuroepithelial cells to radial glia is accompanied by a series of structural and functional changes, including the appearance of \\\"glial\\\" features, as well as the appearance of new signaling molecules and junctional proteins. However, not all radial glia are alike. Radial glial lineages appear to be heterogeneous both within and across different brain regions. Subtypes of neurogenic radial glia within the cortex, for example, may have restricted potential in terms of the cell types they are able to generate. Radial glia located in different brain regions also differ in their expression of growth factors, a diverse number of transcription factors, and the cell types they generate, suggesting that they are involved in regionalization of the developing nervous system in several aspects. These findings highlight the important but complex role of radial glia as participants in key steps of brain development.","tags":null,"title":"Radial glia diversity: a matter of cell fate","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ivic L","Sands TT","Fishkin N","Nakanishi K","Kriegstein AR","Stromgaard K"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1041379200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1041379200,"objectID":"78bfc078117e4d372a55df39be2e1a9a","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/ivic-2003/","publishdate":"2025-12-26T05:29:39.738426Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ivic-2003/","section":"publication","summary":"Glycine and gamma-aminobutyric acid, type A (GABA(A)) receptors are members of the ligand-gated ion channel superfamily that mediate inhibitory synaptic transmission in the adult central nervous system. During development, the activation of these receptors leads to membrane depolarization. Ligands for the two receptors have important implications both in disease therapy and as pharmacological tools. Terpene trilactones (ginkgolides and bilobalide) are unique constituents of Ginkgo biloba extracts that have various effects on the central nervous system. We have investigated the relative potency of these compounds on glycine and GABA(A) receptors. We find that most of the ginkgolides are selective and potent antagonists of the glycine receptor. Bilobalide, the single major component in G. biloba extracts, also reduces glycine-induced currents, although to a lesser extent. Both ginkgolides and bilobalide inhibit GABA(A) receptors, with bilobalide demonstrating a more potent effect. Additionally, we provide evidence that open channels are required for glycine receptor inhibition by ginkgolides. Finally, we employ molecular modeling to elucidate the similarities and differences in the structure of the terpene trilactones to account for the pharmacological properties of these compounds and demonstrate a striking similarity between ginkgolides and picrotoxinin, a GABA(A) and recombinant glycine alpha-homomeric receptor antagonist.","tags":null,"title":"Terpene trilactones from Ginkgo biloba are antagonists of cortical glycine and GABA(A) receptors","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Noctor SC","Flint AC","Weissman TA","Wong WS","Clinton BK","Kriegstein AR"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1009843200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1009843200,"objectID":"bafa4e197787ffdf38b8e7a968d3f55e","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/noctor-2002/","publishdate":"2025-12-26T05:29:39.852567Z","relpermalink":"/publication/noctor-2002/","section":"publication","summary":"The embryonic ventricular zone (VZ) of the cerebral cortex contains migrating neurons, radial glial cells, and a large population of cycling progenitor cells that generate newborn neurons. The latter two cell classes have been assumed for some time to be distinct in both function and anatomy, but the cellular anatomy of the progenitor cell type has remained poorly defined. Several recent reports have raised doubts about the distinction between radial glial and precursor cells by demonstrating that radial glial cells are themselves neuronal progenitor cells (Malatesta et al., 2000; Hartfuss et al., 2001; Miyata et al., 2001; Noctor et al., 2001). This discovery raises the possibility that radial glia and the population of VZ progenitor cells may be one anatomical and functional cell class. Such a hypothesis predicts that throughout neurogenesis almost all mitotically active VZ cells and a substantial percentage of VZ cells overall are radial glia. We have therefore used various anatomical, immunohistochemical, and electrophysiological techniques to test these predictions. Our data demonstrate that the majority of VZ cells, and nearly all mitotically active VZ cells during neurogenesis, both have radial glial morphology and express radial glial markers. In addition, intracellular dye filling of electrophysiologically characterized progenitor cells in the VZ demonstrates that these cells have the morphology of radial glia. Because the vast majority cycling cells in the cortical VZ have characteristics of radial glia, the radial glial precursor cell may be responsible for both the production of newborn neurons and the guidance of daughter neurons to their destinations in the developing cortex.","tags":null,"title":"Dividing precursor cells of the embryonic cortical ventricular zone have morphological and molecular characteristics of radial glia","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Benardete EA","Kriegstein AR"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1009843200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1009843200,"objectID":"ea0768b26f318b1139edb199de20cc87","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/benardete-2002/","publishdate":"2025-12-26T05:29:39.898168Z","relpermalink":"/publication/benardete-2002/","section":"publication","summary":"PURPOSE: Cortical dysplasia (CD) is associated with epilepsy in both the pediatric and adult populations. The mechanism underlying seizures with cortical malformations is still poorly understood. To study the physiology of dysplastic cortex, we developed an experimental model of CD. METHODS: Pregnant rats were given intraperitoneal injections of carmustine (1-3-bis-chloroethyl-nitrosourea; BCNU) on embryonic day 15 (E15). Cortical histology was examined in the resulting pups at P0, P28, and P60. In addition, evoked and spontaneous field potential recordings were obtained in cortical slices from adult control and BCNU-exposed rats. Finally, we used whole-cell recordings to compare physiologic properties of pyramidal neurons and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) responses in control and BCNU-treated animals. RESULTS: Features characteristic of CD were found in the offspring, including laminar disorganization, cytomegalic neurons, and neuronal heterotopias. Dysplastic cortex also contained abnormal clusters of Cajal-Retzius (CR) cells and disruption of radial glial fibers, as demonstrated with immunohistochemistry. Under conditions of partial GABAA-receptor blockade with 10 microM bicuculline methiodide (BMI), slices of dysplastic cortex demonstrated a significant increase in the number of spontaneous and evoked epileptiform discharges. Individual pyramidal neurons in dysplastic cortex were less sensitive to application of GABA compared with controls. CONCLUSIONS: BCNU exposure in utero produces histologic alterations suggestive of CD in rat offspring. Dysplastic cortex from this model demonstrates features of hyperexcitability and decreased neuronal sensitivity to GABA. Such physiologic alterations may underlie the increased epileptogenicity of dysplastic cortex.","tags":null,"title":"Increased excitability and decreased sensitivity to GABA in an animal model of dysplastic cortex","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Owens DF","Kriegstein AR"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1009843200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1009843200,"objectID":"ff169781d75013c67421362dc5dfe6f1","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/owens-2002/","publishdate":"2025-12-26T05:29:39.24024Z","relpermalink":"/publication/owens-2002/","section":"publication","summary":"In the mature brain, GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) functions primarily as an inhibitory neurotransmitter. But it can also act as a trophic factor during nervous system development to influence events such as proliferation, migration, differentiation, synapse maturation and cell death. GABA mediates these processes by the activation of traditional ionotropic and metabotropic receptors, and probably by both synaptic and non-synaptic mechanisms. However, the functional properties of GABA receptor signalling in the immature brain are significantly different from, and in some ways opposite to, those found in the adult brain.
