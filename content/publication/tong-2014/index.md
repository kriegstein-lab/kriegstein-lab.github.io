abstract: The ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ) is an extensive germinal niche
  containing neural stem cells (NSCs) in the walls of the lateral ventricles of the
  adult brain. How the adult brain's neural activity influences the behavior of adult
  NSCs remains largely unknown. We show that serotonergic (5HT) axons originating
  from a small group of neurons in the raphe form an extensive plexus on most of the
  ventricular walls. Electron microscopy revealed intimate contacts between 5HT axons
  and NSCs (B1) or ependymal cells (E1) and these cells were labeled by a transsynaptic
  viral tracer injected into the raphe. B1 cells express the 5HT receptors 2C and
  5A. Electrophysiology showed that activation of these receptors in B1 cells induced
  small inward currents. Intraventricular infusion of 5HT2C agonist or antagonist
  increased or decreased V-SVZ proliferation, respectively. These results indicate
  that supraependymal 5HT axons directly interact with NSCs to regulate neurogenesis
  via 5HT2C.
