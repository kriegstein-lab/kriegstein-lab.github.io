abstract: Greater transcultural and transdisciplinary engagement within Muslim contexts
  and deliberate inclusion of diverse Muslim voices in the development of international
  guidelines is required to improve understanding of the state of stem cell science,
  strengthen thinking about attendant ethical complexities, enhance compliance, deepen
  public deliberation, increase trust, and strengthen practice standards.
