abstract: During brain development, the daughter cells of neural stem cells have to
  make a choice - either to become new stem cells or to differentiate into neurons.
  In a recent issue of Science, Iwata et al. (2020) show that these fate decisions
  can be determined after mitosis by mitochondrial remodeling.
