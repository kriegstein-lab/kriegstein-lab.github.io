 abstract = {Early in development of the central nervous system, radial glial
cells arise from the neuroepithelial cells lining the ventricles
around the time that neurons begin to appear. The transition of
neuroepithelial cells to radial glia is accompanied by a series
of structural and functional changes, including the appearance of
``glial'' features, as well as the appearance of new signaling
molecules and junctional proteins. However, not all radial glia
are alike. Radial glial lineages appear to be heterogeneous both
within and across different brain regions. Subtypes of neurogenic
radial glia within the cortex, for example, may have restricted
potential in terms of the cell types they are able to generate.
Radial glia located in different brain regions also differ in
their expression of growth factors, a diverse number of
transcription factors, and the cell types they generate,
suggesting that they are involved in regionalization of the
developing nervous system in several aspects. These findings
highlight the important but complex role of radial glia as
participants in key steps of brain development.},
