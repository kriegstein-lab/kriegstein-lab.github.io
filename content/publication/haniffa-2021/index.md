abstract: The Human Developmental Cell Atlas (HDCA) initiative, which is part of the
  Human Cell Atlas, aims to create a comprehensive reference map of cells during development.
  This will be critical to understanding normal organogenesis, the effect of mutations,
  environmental factors and infectious agents on human development, congenital and
  childhood disorders, and the cellular basis of ageing, cancer and regenerative medicine.
  Here we outline the HDCA initiative and the challenges of mapping and modelling
  human development using state-of-the-art technologies to create a reference atlas
  across gestation. Similar to the Human Genome Project, the HDCA will integrate the
  output from a growing community of scientists who are mapping human development
  into a unified atlas. We describe the early milestones that have been achieved and
  the use of human stem-cell-derived cultures, organoids and animal models to inform
  the HDCA, especially for prenatal tissues that are hard to acquire. Finally, we
  provide a roadmap towards a complete atlas of human development.
