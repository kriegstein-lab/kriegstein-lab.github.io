abstract: Non-neurogenic cell types, such as cortical astroglia and fibroblasts, can
  be directly converted into neurons by the overexpression of defined transcription
  factors. Normally, the cellular phenotype of such differentiated cells is remarkably
  stable and resists direct cell transdifferentiation. Here we show that the Ink4a/Arf
  (also known as Cdkn2a) locus is a developmental barrier to direct neuronal transdifferentiation
  induced by transcription factor overexpression. With serial passage in vitro, wild-type
  postnatal cortical astroglia become progressively resistant to Dlx2-induced neuronal
  transdifferentiation. In contrast, the neurogenic competence of Ink4a/Arf-deficient
  astroglia is both greatly increased and does not diminish through serial cell culture
  passage. Electrophysiological analysis further demonstrates the neuronal identity
  of cells induced from Ink4a/Arf-null astroglia, and short hairpin RNA-mediated acute
  knockdown of p16Ink4a and p19Arf p16(Ink4a) and p19(Arf) indicates that these gene
  products function postnatally as a barrier to cellular transdifferentiation. Finally,
  we found that mouse fibroblasts deficient for Ink4a/Arf also exhibit greatly enhanced
  transcription factor-induced neuronal induction. These data indicate that Ink4a/Arf
  is a potent barrier to direct neuronal transdifferentiation and further suggest
  that this locus functions normally in the progressive developmental restriction
  of postnatal astrocytes.
