abstract: While thousands of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been identified, few
  lncRNAs that control neural stem cell (NSC) behavior are known. Here, we identify
  Pinky (Pnky) as a neural-specific lncRNA that regulates neurogenesis from NSCs in
  the embryonic and postnatal brain. In postnatal NSCs, Pnky knockdown potentiates
  neuronal lineage commitment and expands the transit-amplifying cell population,
  increasing neuron production several-fold. Pnky is evolutionarily conserved and
  expressed in NSCs of the developing human brain. In the embryonic mouse cortex,
  Pnky knockdown increases neuronal differentiation and depletes the NSC population.
  Pnky interacts with the splicing regulator PTBP1, and PTBP1 knockdown also enhances
  neurogenesis. In NSCs, Pnky and PTBP1 regulate the expression and alternative splicing
  of a core set of transcripts that relates to the cellular phenotype. These data
  thus unveil Pnky as a conserved lncRNA that interacts with a key RNA processing
  factor and regulates neurogenesis from embryonic and postnatal NSC populations.
