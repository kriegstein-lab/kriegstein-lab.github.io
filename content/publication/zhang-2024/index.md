abstract: The ability to spatially map multiple layers of the omics information over
  different time points allows for exploring the mechanisms driving brain development,
  differentiation, arealization, and alterations in disease. Herein we developed and
  applied spatial tri-omic sequencing technologies, DBiT ARP-seq (spatial ATAC-RNA-Protein-seq)
  and DBiT CTRP-seq (spatial CUT&Tag-RNA-Protein-seq) together with multiplexed immunofluorescence
  imaging (CODEX) to map spatial dynamic remodeling in brain development and neuroinflammation.
  A spatiotemporal tri-omic atlas of the mouse brain was obtained at different stages
  from postnatal day P0 to P21, and compared to the regions of interest in the human
  developing brains. Specifically, in the cortical area, we discovered temporal persistence
  and spatial spreading of chromatin accessibility for the layer-defining transcription
  factors. In corpus callosum, we observed dynamic chromatin priming of myelin genes
  across the subregions. Together, it suggests a role for layer specific projection
  neurons to coordinate axonogenesis and myelination. We further mapped the brain
  of a lysolecithin (LPC) neuroinflammation mouse model and observed common molecular
  programs in development and neuroinflammation. Microglia, exhibiting both conserved
  and distinct programs for inflammation and resolution, are transiently activated
  not only at the core of the LPC lesion, but also at distal locations presumably
  through neuronal circuitry. Thus, this work unveiled common and differential mechanisms
  in brain development and neuroinflammation, resulting in a valuable data resource
  to investigate brain development, function and disease.
