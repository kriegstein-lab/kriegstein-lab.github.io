abstract: The excitatory neurons of the mammalian cerebral cortex arise from asymmetric
  divisions of radial glial cells in the ventricular zone and symmetric division of
  intermediate progenitor cells (IPCs) in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the embryonic
  cortex. Little is known about the microenvironment in which IPCs divide or whether
  a stem cell niche exists in the SVZ of the embryonic cortex. Recent evidence suggests
  that vasculature may provide a niche for adult stem cells but its role in development
  is less clear. We have investigated the vasculature in the embryonic cortex during
  neurogenesis and find that IPCs are spatially and temporally associated with blood
  vessels during cortical development. Intermediate progenitors mimic the pattern
  of capillaries suggesting patterns of angiogenesis and neurogenesis are coordinated
  during development. More importantly, we find that IPCs divide near blood vessel
  branch points suggesting that cerebral vasculature establishes a stem cell niche
  for intermediate progenitors in the SVZ. These data provide novel evidence for the
  presence of a neurogenic niche for intermediate progenitors in the embryonic SVZ
  and suggest blood vessels are important for proper patterning of neurogenesis.
