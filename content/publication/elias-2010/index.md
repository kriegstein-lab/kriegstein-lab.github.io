abstract: The adult cerebral cortex is composed of excitatory and inhibitory neurons
  that arise from progenitor cells in disparate proliferative regions in the developing
  brain and follow different migratory paths. Excitatory pyramidal neurons originate
  near the ventricle and migrate radially to their position in the cortical plate
  along radial glial fibers. On the other hand, inhibitory interneurons arise in the
  ventral telencephalon and migrate tangentially to enter the developing cortex before
  migrating radially to reach their correct laminar position. Gap junction adhesion
  has been shown to play an important mechanistic role in the radial migration of
  excitatory neurons. We asked whether a similar mechanism governs the tangential
  or radial migration of inhibitory interneurons. Using short hairpin RNA knockdown
  of Connexin 43 (Cx43) and Cx26 together with rescue experiments, we found that gap
  junctions are dispensable for the tangential migration of interneurons, but that
  Cx43 plays a role in the switch from tangential to radial migration that allows
  interneurons to enter the cortical plate and find their correct laminar position.
  Moreover this action is dependent on the adhesive properties and the C terminus
  of Cx43 but not the Cx43 channel. Thus, the radial phase of interneuron migration
  resembles that of excitatory neuron migration in terms of dependence on Cx43 adhesion.
  Furthermore, gap junctions between migrating interneurons and radial processes were
  observed by electron microscopy. These findings provide mechanistic and structural
  support for a gap junction-mediated interaction between migrating interneurons and
  radial glia during the switch from tangential to radial migration.
