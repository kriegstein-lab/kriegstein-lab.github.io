abstract: The evolution of the human brain has been characterized by an increase in
  the size of the neocortex. Underlying this expansion is a significant increase in
  the number of neurons produced by neural stem cells during early stages of cortical
  development. Here we highlight recent advances in our understating of these cell
  populations, consisting of ventricular radial glia and outer radial glia. We highlight
  how gene expression studies have identified molecular signatures for radial glial
  cell populations and outline what has been learned about the mechanisms underlying
  the characteristic mode of division observed in outer radial glia cells, mitotic
  somal translocation. Understanding the significance of this behavior may help us
  explain human cortical expansion and further elucidate neurodevelopmental diseases.
