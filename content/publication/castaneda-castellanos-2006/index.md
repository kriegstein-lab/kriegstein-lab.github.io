abstract: To obtain electrophysiological recordings in brain slices, sophisticated
  and expensive pieces of equipment can be used. However, costly microscope equipment
  with infrared differential interference contrast optics is not always necessary
  or even desirable. For instance, obtaining a randomized unbiased sample in a given
  preparation would be better accomplished if cells were not directly visualized before
  recording. In addition, some preparations require thick slices, and direct visualization
  is not possible. Here we describe a protocol for the 'blind patch clamp method'
  that we developed several years ago to perform electrophysiological recordings in
  mammalian brain slices using a standard patch clamp amplifier, dissecting microscope
  and recording chamber. Overall, it takes approximately 3-4 h to set up this procedure.
