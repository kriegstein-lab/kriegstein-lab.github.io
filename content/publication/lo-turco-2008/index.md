abstract: In this issue of Cell Stem Cell, Falk and colleagues (Falk et al., 2008)
  demonstrate that differential responsiveness to TGF-beta signaling selectively modulates
  self-renewal of dorsal midbrain stem cells. This observation may lead to strategies
  for expanding specific neural stem cell subtypes.
