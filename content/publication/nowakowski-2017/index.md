abstract: Systematic analyses of spatiotemporal gene expression trajectories during
  organogenesis have been challenging because diverse cell types at different stages
  of maturation and differentiation coexist in the emerging tissues. We identified
  discrete cell types as well as temporally and spatially restricted trajectories
  of radial glia maturation and neurogenesis in developing human telencephalon. These
  lineage-specific trajectories reveal the expression of neurogenic transcription
  factors in early radial glia and enriched activation of mammalian target of rapamycin
  signaling in outer radial glia. Across cortical areas, modest transcriptional differences
  among radial glia cascade into robust typological distinctions among maturing neurons.
  Together, our results support a mixed model of topographical, typological, and temporal
  hierarchies governing cell-type diversity in the developing human telencephalon,
  including distinct excitatory lineages emerging in rostral and caudal cerebral cortex.
