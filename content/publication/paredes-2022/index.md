abstract: The human cortex contains inhibitory interneurons derived from the medial
  ganglionic eminence (MGE), a germinal zone in the embryonic ventral forebrain. How
  this germinal zone generates sufficient interneurons for the human brain remains
  unclear. We found that the human MGE (hMGE) contains nests of proliferative neuroblasts
  with ultrastructural and transcriptomic features that distinguish them from other
  progenitors in the hMGE. When dissociated hMGE cells are transplanted into the neonatal
  mouse brain, they reform into nests containing proliferating neuroblasts that generate
  young neurons that migrate extensively into the mouse forebrain and mature into
  different subtypes of functional interneurons. Together, these results indicate
  that the nest organization and sustained proliferation of neuroblasts in the hMGE
  provide a mechanism for the extended production of interneurons for the human forebrain.
