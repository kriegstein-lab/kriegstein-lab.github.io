abstract: New neurons continue to be generated in the subgranular zone of the dentate
  gyrus of the adult mammalian hippocampus. This process has been linked to learning
  and memory, stress and exercise, and is thought to be altered in neurological disease.
  In humans, some studies have suggested that hundreds of new neurons are added to
  the adult dentate gyrus every day, whereas other studies find many fewer putative
  new neurons. Despite these discrepancies, it is generally believed that the adult
  human hippocampus continues to generate new neurons. Here we show that a defined
  population of progenitor cells does not coalesce in the subgranular zone during
  human fetal or postnatal development. We also find that the number of proliferating
  progenitors and young neurons in the dentate gyrus declines sharply during the first
  year of life and only a few isolated young neurons are observed by 7 and 13 years
  of age. In adult patients with epilepsy and healthy adults (18-77 years; n = 17
  post-mortem samples from controls; n = 12 surgical resection samples from patients
  with epilepsy), young neurons were not detected in the dentate gyrus. In the monkey
  (Macaca mulatta) hippocampus, proliferation of neurons in the subgranular zone was
  found in early postnatal life, but this diminished during juvenile development as
  neurogenesis decreased. We conclude that recruitment of young neurons to the primate
  hippocampus decreases rapidly during the first years of life, and that neurogenesis
  in the dentate gyrus does not continue, or is extremely rare, in adult humans. The
  early decline in hippocampal neurogenesis raises questions about how the function
  of the dentate gyrus differs between humans and other species in which adult hippocampal
  neurogenesis is preserved.
