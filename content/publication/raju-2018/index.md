abstract: The neocortex of primates, including humans, contains more abundant and
  diverse inhibitory neurons compared with rodents, but the molecular foundations
  of these observations are unknown. Through integrative gene coexpression analysis,
  we determined a consensus transcriptional profile of GABAergic neurons in mid-gestation
  human neocortex. By comparing this profile to genes expressed in GABAergic neurons
  purified from neonatal mouse neocortex, we identified conserved and distinct aspects
  of gene expression in these cells between the species. We show here that the calcium-binding
  protein secretagogin (SCGN) is robustly expressed by neocortical GABAergic neurons
  derived from caudal ganglionic eminences (CGE) and lateral ganglionic eminences
  during human but not mouse brain development. Through electrophysiological and morphometric
  analyses, we examined the effects of SCGN expression on GABAergic neuron function
  and form. Forced expression of SCGN in CGE-derived mouse GABAergic neurons significantly
  increased total neurite length and arbor complexity following transplantation into
  mouse neocortex, revealing a molecular pathway that contributes to morphological
  differences in these cells between rodents and primates.
