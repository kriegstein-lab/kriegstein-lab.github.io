abstract: "Organoids are 3D cell culture systems derived from human pluripotent stem cells that contain tissue resident cell types and reflect features of early tissue organization. Neural organoids are a particularly innovative scientific advance given the lack of accessibility of developing human brain tissue and intractability of neurological diseases. Neural organoids have become an invaluable approach to model features of human brain development that are not well reflected in animal models. Organoids also hold promise for the study of atypical cellular, molecular, and genetic features that underscore neurological diseases. Additionally, organoids may provide a platform for testing therapeutics in human cells and are a potential source for cell replacement approaches to brain injury or disease. Despite the promising features of organoids, their broad utility is tempered by a variety of limitations yet to be overcome, including lack of high-fidelity cell types, limited maturation, atypical physiology, and lack of arealization, features that may limit their reliability for certain applications."
