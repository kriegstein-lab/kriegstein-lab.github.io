abstract: About 30% of patient with epilepsy do not respond to available antiepileptic
  drugs. In addition to seizure suppression, novel approaches are needed to prevent
  or alleviate epileptogenic process after various types of brain injuries. The use
  of cell transplants as factories to produce endogeneous anticonvulsants or as bricks
  to repair abnormal ictogenic and epileptogenic neuronal circuits has generated hope
  that cell-based therapies could become a novel therapeutic category in the treatment
  arsenal of epilepsy. Herein we summarize the current status and future perspectives
  of cell-based therapies in the treatment of epilepsy.
