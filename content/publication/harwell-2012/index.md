abstract: The precise connectivity of inputs and outputs is critical for cerebral
  cortex function; however, the cellular mechanisms that establish these connections
  are poorly understood. Here, we show that the secreted molecule Sonic Hedgehog (Shh)
  is involved in synapse formation of a specific cortical circuit. Shh is expressed
  in layer V corticofugal projection neurons and the Shh receptor, Brother of CDO
  (Boc), is expressed in local and callosal projection neurons of layer II/III that
  synapse onto the subcortical projection neurons. Layer V neurons of mice lacking
  functional Shh exhibit decreased synapses. Conversely, the loss of functional Boc
  leads to a reduction in the strength of synaptic connections onto layer Vb, but
  not layer II/III, pyramidal neurons. These results demonstrate that Shh is expressed
  in postsynaptic target cells while Boc is expressed in a complementary population
  of presynaptic input neurons, and they function to guide the formation of cortical
  microcircuitry.
