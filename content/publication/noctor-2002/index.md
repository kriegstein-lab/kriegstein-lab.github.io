abstract: The embryonic ventricular zone (VZ) of the cerebral cortex contains migrating
  neurons, radial glial cells, and a large population of cycling progenitor cells
  that generate newborn neurons. The latter two cell classes have been assumed for
  some time to be distinct in both function and anatomy, but the cellular anatomy
  of the progenitor cell type has remained poorly defined. Several recent reports
  have raised doubts about the distinction between radial glial and precursor cells
  by demonstrating that radial glial cells are themselves neuronal progenitor cells
  (Malatesta et al., 2000; Hartfuss et al., 2001; Miyata et al., 2001; Noctor et al.,
  2001). This discovery raises the possibility that radial glia and the population
  of VZ progenitor cells may be one anatomical and functional cell class. Such a hypothesis
  predicts that throughout neurogenesis almost all mitotically active VZ cells and
  a substantial percentage of VZ cells overall are radial glia. We have therefore
  used various anatomical, immunohistochemical, and electrophysiological techniques
  to test these predictions. Our data demonstrate that the majority of VZ cells, and
  nearly all mitotically active VZ cells during neurogenesis, both have radial glial
  morphology and express radial glial markers. In addition, intracellular dye filling
  of electrophysiologically characterized progenitor cells in the VZ demonstrates
  that these cells have the morphology of radial glia. Because the vast majority cycling
  cells in the cortical VZ have characteristics of radial glia, the radial glial precursor
  cell may be responsible for both the production of newborn neurons and the guidance
  of daughter neurons to their destinations in the developing cortex.
