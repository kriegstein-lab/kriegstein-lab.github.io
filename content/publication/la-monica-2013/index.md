abstract: The human neocortex is increased in size and complexity as compared with
  most other species. Neocortical expansion has recently been attributed to protracted
  neurogenesis by outer radial glial cells in the outer subventricular zone, a region
  present in humans but not in rodents. The mechanisms of human outer radial glial
  cell generation are unknown, but are proposed to involve division of ventricular
  radial glial cells; neural stem cells present in all developing mammals. Here we
  show that human ventricular radial glial cells produce outer radial glial cells
  and seed formation of the outer subventricular zone via horizontal divisions, which
  occur more frequently in humans than in rodents. We further find that outer radial
  glial cell mitotic behaviour is cell intrinsic, and that the basal fibre, inherited
  by outer radial glial cells after ventricular radial glial division, determines
  cleavage angle. Our results suggest that altered regulation of mitotic spindle orientation
  increased outer radial glial cell number, and ultimately neuronal number, during
  human brain evolution.
