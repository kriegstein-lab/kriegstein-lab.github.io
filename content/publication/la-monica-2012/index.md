abstract: Recent discoveries concerning the architecture and cellular dynamics of
  the developing human brain are revealing new differences between mouse and human
  cortical development. In mice, neurons are produced by ventricular radial glial
  (RG) cells and subventricular zone intermediate progenitor (IP) cells. In the human
  cortex, both ventricular RG and highly motile outer RG cells generate IP cells,
  which undergo multiple rounds of transit amplification in the outer subventricular
  zone before producing neurons. This creates a more complex environment for neurogenesis
  and neuronal migration, adding new arenas in which neurodevelopmental disease gene
  mutation could disrupt corticogenesis. A more complete understanding of disease
  mechanisms will involve use of emerging model systems with developmental programs
  more similar to that of the human neocortex.
