abstract: The rapid spread of Zika virus (ZIKV) and its association with abnormal
  brain development constitute a global health emergency. Congenital ZIKV infection
  produces a range of mild to severe pathologies, including microcephaly. To understand
  the pathophysiology of ZIKV infection, we used models of the developing brain that
  faithfully recapitulate the tissue architecture in early to midgestation. We identify
  the brain cell populations that are most susceptible to ZIKV infection in primary
  human tissue, provide evidence for a mechanism of viral entry, and show that a commonly
  used antibiotic protects cultured brain cells by reducing viral proliferation. In
  the brain, ZIKV preferentially infected neural stem cells, astrocytes, oligodendrocyte
  precursor cells, and microglia, whereas neurons were less susceptible to infection.
  These findings suggest mechanisms for microcephaly and other pathologic features
  of infants with congenital ZIKV infection that are not explained by neural stem
  cell infection alone, such as calcifications in the cortical plate. Furthermore,
  we find that blocking the glia-enriched putative viral entry receptor AXL reduced
  ZIKV infection of astrocytes in vitro, and genetic knockdown of AXL in a glial cell
  line nearly abolished infection. Finally, we evaluate 2,177 compounds, focusing
  on drugs safe in pregnancy. We show that the macrolide antibiotic azithromycin reduced
  viral proliferation and virus-induced cytopathic effects in glial cell lines and
  human astrocytes. Our characterization of infection in the developing human brain
  clarifies the pathogenesis of congenital ZIKV infection and provides the basis for
  investigating possible therapeutic strategies to safely alleviate or prevent the
  most severe consequences of the epidemic.
