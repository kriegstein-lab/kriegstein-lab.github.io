abstract: The development of the human neocortex is a highly dynamic process and involves
  complex cellular trajectories controlled by cell-type-specific gene regulation(1).
  Here, we collected paired single-nucleus chromatin accessibility and transcriptome
  data from 38 human neocortical samples encompassing both the prefrontal cortex and
  primary visual cortex. These samples span five main developmental stages, ranging
  from the first trimester to adolescence. In parallel, we performed spatial transcriptomic
  analysis on a subset of the samples to illustrate spatial organization and intercellular
  communication. This atlas enables us to catalog cell type-, age-, and area-specific
  gene regulatory networks underlying neural differentiation. Moreover, combining
  single-cell profiling, progenitor purification, and lineage-tracing experiments,
  we have untangled the complex lineage relationships among progenitor subtypes during
  the transition from neurogenesis to gliogenesis in the human neocortex. We identified
  a tripotential intermediate progenitor subtype, termed Tri-IPC, responsible for
  the local production of GABAergic neurons, oligodendrocyte precursor cells, and
  astrocytes. Remarkably, most glioblastoma cells resemble Tri-IPCs at the transcriptomic
  level, suggesting that cancer cells hijack developmental processes to enhance growth
  and heterogeneity. Furthermore, by integrating our atlas data with large-scale GWAS
  data, we created a disease-risk map highlighting enriched ASD risk in second-trimester
  intratelencephalic projection neurons. Our study sheds light on the gene regulatory
  landscape and cellular dynamics of the developing human neocortex.
