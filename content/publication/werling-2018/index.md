abstract: Genomic association studies of common or rare protein-coding variation have
  established robust statistical approaches to account for multiple testing. Here
  we present a comparable framework to evaluate rare and de novo noncoding single-nucleotide
  variants, insertion/deletions, and all classes of structural variation from whole-genome
  sequencing (WGS). Integrating genomic annotations at the level of nucleotides, genes,
  and regulatory regions, we define 51,801 annotation categories. Analyses of 519
  autism spectrum disorder families did not identify association with any categories
  after correction for 4,123 effective tests. Without appropriate correction, biologically
  plausible associations are observed in both cases and controls. Despite excluding
  previously identified gene-disrupting mutations, coding regions still exhibited
  the strongest associations. Thus, in autism, the contribution of de novo noncoding
  variation is probably modest in comparison to that of de novo coding variants. Robust
  results from future WGS studies will require large cohorts and comprehensive analytical
  strategies that consider the substantial multiple-testing burden.
