abstract: The lipidome is currently understudied but fundamental to life. Within the
  brain, little is known about cell-type lipid heterogeneity, and even less is known
  about cell-to-cell lipid diversity because it is difficult to study the lipids within
  individual cells. Here, we used single-cell mass spectrometry-based protocols to
  profile the lipidomes of 154 910 single cells across ten individuals consisting
  of five developmental ages and five brain regions, resulting in a unique lipid atlas
  available via a web browser of the developing human brain. From these data, we identify
  differentially expressed lipids across brain structures, cortical areas, and developmental
  ages. We inferred lipid profiles of several major cell types from this data set
  and additionally detected putative cell-type specific lipids. This data set will
  enable further interrogation of the developing human brain lipidome.
