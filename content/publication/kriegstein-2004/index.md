abstract: Real-time imaging of migrating neurons has changed our understanding of
  how newborn neurons reach their final positions in the developing cerebral cortex.
  The migratory routes and modes of migration are more diverse and complex than previously
  thought. The finding that cortical interneurons migrate to the cortex from origins
  in the ventral telencephalon has already markedly altered our view of cortical migration.
  More recent findings have demonstrated additional nuances in the migratory pattern
  and highlighted differences between subsets of interneurons. Moreover, radial migration
  of pyramidal neurons does not progress smoothly from ventricle to cortical plate,
  but is instead characterized by distinct migratory phases in which neurons change
  shape and direction of movement. Integrating these findings with the molecular machinery
  underlying migration will provide a more complete picture of how the cerebral cortex
  is assembled.
