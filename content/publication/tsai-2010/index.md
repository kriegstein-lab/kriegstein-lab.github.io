abstract: Radial glial progenitor cells exhibit bidirectional cell cycle-dependent
  nuclear oscillations. The purpose and underlying mechanism of this unusual 'interkinetic
  nuclear migration' are poorly understood. We investigated the basis for this behavior
  by live imaging of nuclei, centrosomes and microtubules in embryonic rat brain slices,
  coupled with the use of RNA interference (RNAi) and the myosin inhibitor blebbistatin.
  We found that nuclei migrated independent of centrosomes and unidirectionally away
  from or toward the ventricular surface along microtubules, which were uniformly
  oriented from the ventricular surface to the pial surface of the brain. RNAi directed
  against cytoplasmic dynein specifically inhibited nuclear movement toward the apical
  surface. An RNAi screen of kinesin genes identified Kif1a, a member of the kinesin-3
  family, as the motor for basally directed nuclear movement. These observations provide
  direct evidence that kinesins are involved in nuclear migration and neurogenesis
  and suggest that a cell cycle-dependent switch between distinct microtubule motors
  drives interkinetic nuclear migration.
