abstract: The majority of neurons in the adult neocortex are produced embryonically
  during a brief but intense period of neuronal proliferation. The radial glial cell,
  a transient embryonic cell type known for its crucial role in neuronal migration,
  has recently been shown to function as a neuronal progenitor cell and appears to
  produce most cortical pyramidal neurons. Radial glial cell modulation could thus
  affect neuron production, neuronal migration, and overall cortical architecture;
  however, signaling mechanisms among radial glia have not been studied directly.
  We demonstrate here that calcium waves propagate through radial glial cells in the
  proliferative cortical ventricular zone (VZ). Radial glial calcium waves occur spontaneously
  and require connexin hemichannels, P2Y1 ATP receptors, and intracellular IP3-mediated
  calcium release. Furthermore, we show that wave disruption decreases VZ proliferation
  during the peak of embryonic neurogenesis. Taken together, these results demonstrate
  a radial glial signaling mechanism that may regulate cortical neuronal production.
