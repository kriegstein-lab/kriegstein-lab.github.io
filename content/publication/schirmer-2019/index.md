abstract: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neuroinflammatory disease with a relapsing-remitting
  disease course at early stages, distinct lesion characteristics in cortical grey
  versus subcortical white matter and neurodegeneration at chronic stages. Here we
  used single-nucleus RNA sequencing to assess changes in expression in multiple cell
  lineages in MS lesions and validated the results using multiplex in situ hybridization.
  We found selective vulnerability and loss of excitatory CUX2-expressing projection
  neurons in upper-cortical layers underlying meningeal inflammation; such MS neuron
  populations exhibited upregulation of stress pathway genes and long non-coding RNAs.
  Signatures of stressed oligodendrocytes, reactive astrocytes and activated microglia
  mapped most strongly to the rim of MS plaques. Notably, single-nucleus RNA sequencing
  identified phagocytosing microglia and/or macrophages by their ingestion and perinuclear
  import of myelin transcripts, confirmed by functional mouse and human culture assays.
  Our findings indicate lineage- and region-specific transcriptomic changes associated
  with selective cortical neuron damage and glial activation contributing to progression
  of MS lesions.
