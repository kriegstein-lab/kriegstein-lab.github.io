abstract: The medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) is an embryonic forebrain structure
  that generates the majority of cortical interneurons. MGE transplantation into specific
  regions of the postnatal central nervous system modifies circuit function and improves
  deficits in mouse models of epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, pain, and phencyclidine-induced
  cognitive deficits. Herein, we describe approaches to generate MGE-like progenitor
  cells from mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. Using a modified embryoid body method,
  we provided gene expression evidence that mouse ES-derived Lhx6(+) cells closely
  resemble immature interneurons generated from authentic MGE-derived Lhx6(+) cells.
  We hypothesized that enhancers that are active in the mouse MGE would be useful
  tools in detecting when ES cells differentiate into MGE cells. Here we demonstrate
  the utility of enhancer elements [422 (DlxI12b), Lhx6, 692, 1056, and 1538] as tools
  to mark MGE-like cells in ES cell differentiation experiments. We found that enhancers
  DlxI12b, 692, and 1538 are active in Lhx6-GFP(+) cells, while enhancer 1056 is active
  in Olig2(+) cells. These data demonstrate unique techniques to follow and purify
  MGE-like derivatives from ES cells, including GABAergic cortical interneurons and
  oligodendrocytes, for use in stem cell-based therapeutic assays and treatments.
