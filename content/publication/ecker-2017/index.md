abstract: A comprehensive characterization of neuronal cell types, their distributions,
  and patterns of connectivity is critical for understanding the properties of neural
  circuits and how they generate behaviors. Here we review the experiences of the
  BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Consortium, ten pilot projects funded by the U.S. BRAIN
  Initiative, in developing, validating, and scaling up emerging genomic and anatomical
  mapping technologies for creating a complete inventory of neuronal cell types and
  their connections in multiple species and during development. These projects lay
  the foundation for a larger and longer-term effort to generate whole-brain cell
  atlases in species including mice and humans.
