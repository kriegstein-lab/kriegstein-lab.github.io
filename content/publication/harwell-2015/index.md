abstract: 'The mammalian neocortex is composed of two major neuronal cell types with
  distinct origins: excitatory pyramidal neurons and inhibitory interneurons, generated
  in dorsal and ventral progenitor zones of the embryonic telencephalon, respectively.
  Thus, inhibitory neurons migrate relatively long distances to reach their destination
  in the developing forebrain. The role of lineage in the organization and circuitry
  of interneurons is still not well understood. Utilizing a combination of genetics,
  retroviral fate mapping, and lineage-specific retroviral barcode labeling, we find
  that clonally related interneurons can be widely dispersed while unrelated interneurons
  can be closely clustered. These data suggest that migratory mechanisms related to
  the clustering of interneurons occur largely independent of their clonal origin.'
