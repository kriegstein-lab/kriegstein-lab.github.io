abstract: 'Although tumor-propagating cells can be derived from glioblastomas (GBM)
  of the proneural and mesenchymal subtypes, a glioma stem-like cell (GSC) of the
  classic subtype has not been identified. It is unclear whether mesenchymal GSCs
  (mGSC) and/or proneural GSCs (pGSC) alone are sufficient to generate the heterogeneity
  observed in GBM. We performed single-cell/single-nucleus RNA sequencing of 28 gliomas,
  and single-cell ATAC sequencing for 8 cases. We found that GBM GSCs reside on a
  single axis of variation, ranging from proneural to mesenchymal. In silico lineage
  tracing using both transcriptomics and genetics supports mGSCs as the progenitors
  of pGSCs. Dual inhibition of pGSC-enriched and mGSC-enriched growth and survival
  pathways provides a more complete treatment than combinations targeting one GSC
  phenotype alone. This study sheds light on a long-standing debate regarding lineage
  relationships among GSCs and presents a paradigm by which personalized combination
  therapies can be derived from single-cell RNA signatures, to overcome intratumor
  heterogeneity. SIGNIFICANCE: Tumor-propagating cells can be derived from mesenchymal
  and proneural glioblastomas. However, a stem cell of the classic subtype has yet
  to be demonstrated. We show that classic-subtype gliomas are comprised of proneural
  and mesenchymal cells. This study sheds light on a long-standing debate regarding
  lineage relationships between glioma cell types.See related commentary by Fine,
