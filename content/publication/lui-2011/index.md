abstract: The size and surface area of the mammalian brain are thought to be critical
  determinants of intellectual ability. Recent studies show that development of the
  gyrated human neocortex involves a lineage of neural stem and transit-amplifying
  cells that forms the outer subventricular zone (OSVZ), a proliferative region outside
  the ventricular epithelium. We discuss how proliferation of cells within the OSVZ
  expands the neocortex by increasing neuron number and modifying the trajectory of
  migrating neurons. Relating these features to other mammalian species and known
  molecular regulators of the mouse neocortex suggests how this developmental process
  could have emerged in evolution.
