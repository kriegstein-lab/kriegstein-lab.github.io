abstract: Neurons in the developing rodent cortex are generated from radial glial
  cells that function as neural stem cells. These epithelial cells line the cerebral
  ventricles and generate intermediate progenitor cells that migrate into the subventricular
  zone (SVZ) and proliferate to increase neuronal number. The developing human SVZ
  has a massively expanded outer region (OSVZ) thought to contribute to cortical size
  and complexity. However, OSVZ progenitor cell types and their contribution to neurogenesis
  are not well understood. Here we show that large numbers of radial glia-like cells
  and intermediate progenitor cells populate the human OSVZ. We find that OSVZ radial
  glia-like cells have a long basal process but, surprisingly, are non-epithelial
  as they lack contact with the ventricular surface. Using real-time imaging and clonal
  analysis, we demonstrate that these cells can undergo proliferative divisions and
  self-renewing asymmetric divisions to generate neuronal progenitor cells that can
  proliferate further. We also show that inhibition of Notch signalling in OSVZ progenitor
  cells induces their neuronal differentiation. The establishment of non-ventricular
  radial glia-like cells may have been a critical evolutionary advance underlying
  increased cortical size and complexity in the human brain.
