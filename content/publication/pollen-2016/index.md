abstract: Sensory experience evokes long-lasting changes in neural circuits through
  activity-dependent gene expression. Ataman et al. (2016) report in Nature that primates
  evolved novel transcriptional responses to neuronal activity, including induction
  of musclin/osteocrin (OSTN), which may regulate specialized aspects of primate neural
  circuits.
