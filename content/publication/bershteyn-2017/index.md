abstract: Classical lissencephaly is a genetic neurological disorder associated with
  mental retardation and intractable epilepsy, and Miller-Dieker syndrome (MDS) is
  the most severe form of the disease. In this study, to investigate the effects of
  MDS on human progenitor subtypes that control neuronal output and influence brain
  topology, we analyzed cerebral organoids derived from control and MDS-induced pluripotent
  stem cells (iPSCs) using time-lapse imaging, immunostaining, and single-cell RNA
  sequencing. We saw a cell migration defect that was rescued when we corrected the
  MDS causative chromosomal deletion and severe apoptosis of the founder neuroepithelial
  stem cells, accompanied by increased horizontal cell divisions. We also identified
  a mitotic defect in outer radial glia, a progenitor subtype that is largely absent
  from lissencephalic rodents but critical for human neocortical expansion. Our study,
  therefore, deepens our understanding of MDS cellular pathogenesis and highlights
  the broad utility of cerebral organoids for modeling human neurodevelopmental disorders.
