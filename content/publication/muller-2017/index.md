abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are abundant in gliomas
  and immunosuppressive TAMs are a barrier to emerging immunotherapies. It is unknown
  to what extent macrophages derived from peripheral blood adopt the phenotype of
  brain-resident microglia in pre-treatment gliomas. The relative proportions of blood-derived
  macrophages and microglia have been poorly quantified in clinical samples due to
  a paucity of markers that distinguish these cell types in malignant tissue. RESULTS:
  We perform single-cell RNA-sequencing of human gliomas and identify phenotypic differences
  in TAMs of distinct lineages. We isolate TAMs from patient biopsies and compare
  them with macrophages from non-malignant human tissue, glioma atlases, and murine
  glioma models. We present a novel signature that distinguishes TAMs by ontogeny
  in human gliomas. Blood-derived TAMs upregulate immunosuppressive cytokines and
  show an altered metabolism compared to microglial TAMs. They are also enriched in
  perivascular and necrotic regions. The gene signature of blood-derived TAMs, but
  not microglial TAMs, correlates with significantly inferior survival in low-grade
  glioma. Surprisingly, TAMs frequently co-express canonical pro-inflammatory (M1)
  and alternatively activated (M2) genes in individual cells. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude
  that blood-derived TAMs significantly infiltrate pre-treatment gliomas, to a degree
  that varies by glioma subtype and tumor compartment. Blood-derived TAMs do not universally
  conform to the phenotype of microglia, but preferentially express immunosuppressive
  cytokines and show an altered metabolism. Our results argue against status quo therapeutic
  strategies that target TAMs indiscriminately and in favor of strategies that specifically
  target immunosuppressive blood-derived TAMs.'
