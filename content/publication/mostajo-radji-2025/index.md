abstract: Neuronal subtype generation in the mammalian central nervous system is governed
  by competing genetic programs. The medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) produces two
  major cortical interneuron (IN) populations, somatostatin (Sst) and parvalbumin
  (Pvalb), which develop on different timelines. The extent to which external signals
  influence these identities remains unclear. Pvalb-positive INs are crucial for cortical
  circuit regulation but challenging to model in vitro. We grafted mouse MGE progenitors
  into diverse 2D and 3D co-culture systems, including mouse and human cortical, MGE,
  and thalamic models. Strikingly, only 3D human corticogenesis models promoted efficient,
  non-autonomous Pvalb differentiation, characterized by upregulation of Pvalb maturation
  markers, downregulation of Sst-specific markers, and the formation of perineuronal
  nets. Additionally, lineage-traced postmitotic Sst-positive INs upregulated Pvalb
  when grafted onto human cortical models. These findings reveal unexpected fate plasticity
  in MGE-derived INs, suggesting that their identities can be dynamically shaped by
  the environment.
