abstract: The development and diversity of neuronal subtypes in the human hypothalamus
  has been insufficiently characterized. To address this, we integrated transcriptomic
  data from 241,096 cells (126,840 newly generated) in the prenatal and adult human
  hypothalamus to reveal a temporal trajectory from proliferative stem cell populations
  to mature hypothalamic cell types. Iterative clustering of the adult neurons identified
  108 robust transcriptionally distinct neuronal subtypes representing 10 hypothalamic
  nuclei. Pseudotime trajectories provided insights into the genes driving formation
  of these nuclei. Comparisons to single-cell transcriptomic data from the mouse hypothalamus
  suggested extensive conservation of neuronal subtypes despite certain differences
  in species-enriched gene expression. The uniqueness of hypothalamic neuronal lineages
  was examined developmentally by comparing excitatory lineages present in cortex
  and inhibitory lineages in ganglionic eminence, revealing both distinct and shared
  drivers of neuronal maturation across the human forebrain. These results provide
  a comprehensive transcriptomic view of human hypothalamus development through gestation
  and adulthood at cellular resolution.
