abstract: Interneurons of the cerebral cortex represent a heterogeneous population
  of cells with important roles in network function. At present, little is known about
  how these neurons are specified in the developing telencephalon. To explore whether
  this diversity is established in the early progenitor populations, we conducted
  in utero fate-mapping of the mouse medial and caudal ganglionic eminences (MGE and
  CGE, respectively), from which most cortical interneurons arise. Mature interneuron
  subtypes were assessed by electrophysiological and immunological analysis, as well
  as by morphological reconstruction. At E13.5, the MGE gives rise to fast-spiking
  (FS) interneurons, whereas the CGE generates predominantly regular-spiking interneurons
  (RSNP). Later at E15.5, the CGE produces RSNP classes distinct from those generated
  from the E13.5 CGE. Thus, we provide evidence that the spatial and temporal origin
  of interneuron precursors in the developing telencephalic eminences predicts the
  intrinsic physiological properties of mature interneurons.
