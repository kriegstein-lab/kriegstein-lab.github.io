abstract: Interactions between angiogenesis and neurogenesis regulate embryonic brain
  development. However, a comprehensive understanding of the stages of vascular cell
  maturation is lacking, especially in the prenatal human brain. Using fluorescence-activated
  cell sorting, single-cell transcriptomics, and histological and ultrastructural
  analyses, we show that an ensemble of endothelial and mural cell subtypes tile the
  brain vasculature during the second trimester. These vascular cells follow distinct
  developmental trajectories and utilize diverse signaling mechanisms, including collagen,
  laminin, and midkine, to facilitate cell-cell communication and maturation. Interestingly,
  our results reveal that tip cells, a subtype of endothelial cells, are highly enriched
  near the ventricular zone, the site of active neurogenesis. Consistent with these
  observations, prenatal vascular cells transplanted into cortical organoids exhibit
  restricted lineage potential that favors tip cells, promotes neurogenesis, and reduces
  cellular stress. Together, our results uncover important mechanisms into vascular
  maturation during this critical period of human brain development.
