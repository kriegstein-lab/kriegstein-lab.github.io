abstract: Human embryonic stem cell-derived retinal pigment epithelial cells (hESC-RPE)
  are a promising cell source to treat age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Despite
  several ongoing clinical studies, a detailed mapping of transient cellular states
  during in vitro differentiation has not been performed. Here, we conduct single-cell
  transcriptomic profiling of an hESC-RPE differentiation protocol that has been developed
  for clinical use. Differentiation progressed through a culture diversification recapitulating
  early embryonic development, whereby cells rapidly acquired a rostral embryo patterning
  signature before converging toward the RPE lineage. At intermediate steps, we identified
  and examined the potency of an NCAM1(+) retinal progenitor population and showed
  the ability of the protocol to suppress non-RPE fates. We demonstrated that the
  method produces a pure RPE pool capable of maturing further after subretinal transplantation
  in a large-eyed animal model. Our evaluation of hESC-RPE differentiation supports
  the development of safe and efficient pluripotent stem cell-based therapies for
  AMD.
