abstract: To discover regulatory elements driving the specificity of gene expression
  in different cell types and regions of the developing human brain, we generated
  an atlas of open chromatin from nine dissected regions of the mid-gestation human
  telencephalon, as well as microdissected upper and deep layers of the prefrontal
  cortex. We identified a subset of open chromatin regions (OCRs), termed predicted
  regulatory elements (pREs), that are likely to function as developmental brain enhancers.
  pREs showed temporal, regional, and laminar differences in chromatin accessibility
  and were correlated with gene expression differences across regions and gestational
  ages. We identified two functional de novo variants in a pRE for autism risk gene
  SLC6A1, and using CRISPRa, demonstrated that this pRE regulates SCL6A1. Additionally,
  mouse transgenic experiments validated enhancer activity for pREs proximal to FEZF2
  and BCL11A. Thus, this atlas serves as a resource for decoding neurodevelopmental
  gene regulation in health and disease.
