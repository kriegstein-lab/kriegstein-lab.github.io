abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Transplantation of cells derived through the manipulation of
  pluripotent stem cells may involve great uncertainty and the possibility of serious
  risks. PURPOSE: To develop guidelines for the ethical conduct of clinical trials
  using such stem cells. METHODS: Review of literature on clinical trials ethics and
  clinical applications of stem cells; critical deliberation on potential guidelines.
  RESULTS: Such transplantation should be allowed in clinical practice only after
  clinical trials demonstrate efficacy and safety. These clinical trials should follow
  ethical principles that guide all clinical research. Additional requirements to
  strengthen trial design, coordinate scientific and ethics review, verify that participants
  understand key features of the trial, and ensure publication of findings are also
  warranted because of the highly innovative nature of the intervention, limited experience
  in humans, and the high hopes of patients who have no alternative effective treatments.
  LIMITATIONS: These recommendations will need to be modified in light of actual experience
  with stem cell clinical trials. CONCLUSIONS: These recommendations will help guarantee
  that the efficacy and safety of innovative stem cell interventions will be rigorously
  established, while also protecting study participants.'
