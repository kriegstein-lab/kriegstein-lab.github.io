abstract: Mutations in the human progranulin (GRN) gene are a leading cause of frontotemporal
  lobar degeneration (FTLD). While previous studies implicate aberrant microglial
  activation as a disease-driving factor in neurodegeneration in the thalamocortical
  circuit in Grn-/- mice, the exact mechanism for neurodegeneration in FTLD-GRN remains
  unclear. By performing comparative single-cell transcriptomics in the thalamus and
  frontal cortex of Grn-/- mice and patients with FTLD-GRN, we have uncovered a highly
  conserved astroglial pathology characterized by upregulation of gap junction protein
  GJA1, water channel AQP4, and lipid-binding protein APOE, and downregulation of
  glutamate transporter SLC1A2 that promoted profound synaptic degeneration across
  the two species. This astroglial toxicity could be recapitulated in mouse astrocyte-neuron
  cocultures and by transplanting induced pluripotent stem cell-derived astrocytes
  to cortical organoids, where progranulin-deficient astrocytes promoted synaptic
  degeneration, neuronal stress, and TDP-43 proteinopathy. Together, these results
  reveal a previously unappreciated astroglial pathology as a potential key mechanism
  in neurodegeneration in FTLD-GRN.
