abstract: Neuropathic pain and bladder dysfunction represent significant quality-of-life
  issues for many spinal cord injury patients. Loss of GABAergic tone in the injured
  spinal cord may contribute to the emergence of these symptoms. Previous studies
  have shown that transplantation of rodent inhibitory interneuron precursors from
  the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) enhances GABAergic signaling in the brain and
  spinal cord. Here we look at whether transplanted MGE-like cells derived from human
  embryonic stem cells (hESC-MGEs) can mitigate the pathological effects of spinal
  cord injury. We find that 6 months after transplantation into injured mouse spinal
  cords, hESC-MGEs differentiate into GABAergic neuron subtypes and receive synaptic
  inputs, suggesting functional integration into host spinal cord. Moreover, the transplanted
  animals show improved bladder function and mitigation of pain-related symptoms.
  Our results therefore suggest that this approach may be a valuable strategy for
  ameliorating the adverse effects of spinal cord injury.
