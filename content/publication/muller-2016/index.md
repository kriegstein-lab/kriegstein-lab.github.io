abstract: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and aggressive type of
  primary brain tumor. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) and platelet-derived growth factor
  (PDGF) receptors are frequently amplified and/or possess gain-of-function mutations
  in GBM However, clinical trials of tyrosine-kinase inhibitors have shown disappointing
  efficacy, in part due to intra-tumor heterogeneity. To assess the effect of clonal
  heterogeneity on gene expression, we derived an approach to map single-cell expression
  profiles to sequentially acquired mutations identified from exome sequencing. Using
  288 single cells, we constructed high-resolution phylogenies of EGF-driven and PDGF-driven
  GBMs, modeling transcriptional kinetics during tumor evolution. Descending the phylogenetic
  tree of a PDGF-driven tumor corresponded to a progressive induction of an oligodendrocyte
  progenitor-like cell type, expressing pro-angiogenic factors. In contrast, phylogenetic
  analysis of an EGFR-amplified tumor showed an up-regulation of pro-invasive genes.
  An in-frame deletion in a specific dimerization domain of PDGF receptor correlates
  with an up-regulation of growth pathways in a proneural GBM and enhances proliferation
  when ectopically expressed in glioma cell lines. In-frame deletions in this domain
  are frequent in public GBM data.
