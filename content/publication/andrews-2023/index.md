abstract: Radial glial (RG) development is essential for cerebral cortex growth and
  organization. In humans, the outer radial glia (oRG) subtype is expanded and gives
  rise to diverse neurons and glia. However, the mechanisms regulating oRG differentiation
  are unclear. oRG cells express leukemia-inhibitory factor (LIF) receptors during
  neurogenesis, and consistent with a role in stem cell self-renewal, LIF perturbation
  impacts oRG proliferation in cortical tissue and organoids. Surprisingly, LIF treatment
  also increases the production of inhibitory interneurons (INs) in cortical cultures.
  Comparative transcriptomic analysis identifies that the enhanced IN population resembles
  INs produced in the caudal ganglionic eminence. To evaluate whether INs could arise
  from oRGs, we isolated primary oRG cells and cultured them with LIF. We observed
  the production of INs from oRG cells and an increase in IN abundance following LIF
  treatment. Our observations suggest that LIF signaling regulates the capacity of
  oRG cells to generate INs.
