abstract: The morphological development of the cerebral cortex from a primitive neuroepithelium
  into a complex laminar structure underlying higher cognition must rely on a network
  of intercellular signaling. Gap junctions are widely expressed during embryonic
  development and provide a means of cell-cell contact and communication. We review
  the roles of gap junctions in regulating the proliferation of neural progenitors
  as well as the migration and differentiation of young neurons in the embryonic cerebral
  cortex. There is substantial evidence that although gap junctions act in the classical
  manner coupling neural progenitors, they also act as hemichannels mediating the
  spread of calcium waves across progenitor cell populations and as adhesive molecules
  aiding neuronal migration. Gap junctions are thus emerging as multifaceted regulators
  of cortical development playing diverse roles in intercellular communication.
