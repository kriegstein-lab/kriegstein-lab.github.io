abstract: Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) is the most common focal epilepsy.
  One-third of patients have drug-refractory seizures and are left with suboptimal
  therapeutic options such as brain tissue-destructive surgery. Here, we report the
  development and characterization of a cell therapy alternative for drug-resistant
  MTLE, which is derived from a human embryonic stem cell line and comprises cryopreserved,
  post-mitotic, medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) pallial-type GABAergic interneurons.
  Single-dose intrahippocampal delivery of the interneurons in a mouse model of chronic
  MTLE resulted in consistent mesiotemporal seizure suppression, with most animals
  becoming seizure-free and surviving longer. The grafted interneurons dispersed locally,
  functionally integrated, persisted long term, and significantly reduced dentate
  granule cell dispersion, a pathological hallmark of MTLE. These disease-modifying
  effects were dose-dependent, with a broad therapeutic range. No adverse effects
  were observed. These findings support an ongoing phase 1/2 clinical trial (NCT05135091)
  for drug-resistant MTLE.
