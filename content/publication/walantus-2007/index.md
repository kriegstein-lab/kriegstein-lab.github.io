abstract: In-utero in-vivo injection and electroporation of the embryonic rat neocortex
  provides a powerful tool for the manipulation of individual progenitors lining the
  walls of the lateral ventricle. This technique is now widely used to study the processes
  involved in corticogenesis by over-expressing or knocking down genes and observing
  the effects on cellular proliferation, migration, and differentiation. In comparison
  to traditional knockout strategies, in-utero electroporation provides a rapid means
  to manipulate a population of cells during a specific temporal window. In this video
  protocol we outline the experimental methodology for preparing rats for surgery,
  exposing the uterine horns through laporatomy, injecting DNA into the lateral ventricles
  of the developing embryo, electroporating DNA into the progenitors lining the lateral
  wall, and caring for animals post-surgery. Our laboratory uses this protocol for
  surgeries on E15-E21 rats, however it is most commonly performed at E16 as shown
  in this video.
