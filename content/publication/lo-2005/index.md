abstract: Scientific progress in human embryonic stem cell (hESC) research and increased
  funding make it imperative to look ahead to the ethical issues generated by the
  expected use of hESCs for transplantation. Several issues should be addressed now,
  even though phase I clinical trials of hESC transplantation are still in the future.
  To minimize the risk of hESC transplantation, donors of materials used to derive
  hESC lines will need to be recontacted to update their medical history and screening.
  Because of privacy concerns, such recontact needs to be discussed and agreed to
  at the time of donation, before new hESC lines are derived. Informed consent for
  phase I clinical trials of hESC transplantation also raises ethical concerns. In
  previous phase I trials of highly innovative interventions, allegations that trial
  participants had not really understood the risk and benefits caused delays in subsequent
  trials. Thus, researchers should consider what information needs to be discussed
  during the consent process for hESC clinical trials and how to verify that participants
  have a realistic understanding of the study. Lack of attention to the special ethical
  concerns raised by clinical trials of hESC transplantation and their implications
  for the derivation of new hESC lines may undermine or delay progress toward stem
  cell therapies.
