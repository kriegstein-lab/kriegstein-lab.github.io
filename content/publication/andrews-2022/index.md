abstract: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) readily
  infects a variety of cell types impacting the function of vital organ systems, with
  particularly severe impact on respiratory function. Neurological symptoms, which
  range in severity, accompany as many as one-third of COVID-19 cases, indicating
  a potential vulnerability of neural cell types. To assess whether human cortical
  cells can be directly infected by SARS-CoV-2, we utilized stem-cell-derived cortical
  organoids as well as primary human cortical tissue, both from developmental and
  adult stages. We find significant and predominant infection in cortical astrocytes
  in both primary tissue and organoid cultures, with minimal infection of other cortical
  populations. Infected and bystander astrocytes have a corresponding increase in
  inflammatory gene expression, reactivity characteristics, increased cytokine and
  growth factor signaling, and cellular stress. Although human cortical cells, particularly
  astrocytes, have no observable ACE2 expression, we find high levels of coronavirus
  coreceptors in infected astrocytes, including CD147 and DPP4. Decreasing coreceptor
  abundance and activity reduces overall infection rate, and increasing expression
  is sufficient to promote infection. Thus, we find tropism of SARS-CoV-2 for human
  astrocytes resulting in inflammatory gliosis-type injury that is dependent on coronavirus
  coreceptors.
