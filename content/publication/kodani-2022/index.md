abstract: Zika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus transmitted via mosquitoes and sex to
  cause congenital neurodevelopmental defects, including microcephaly. Inherited forms
  of microcephaly (MCPH) are associated with disrupted centrosome organization. Similarly,
  we found that ZIKV infection disrupted centrosome organization. ZIKV infection disrupted
  the organization of centrosomal proteins including CEP63, a MCPH-associated protein.
  The ZIKV nonstructural protein NS3 bound CEP63, and expression of NS3 was sufficient
  to alter centrosome architecture and CEP63 localization. Loss of CEP63 suppressed
  ZIKV-induced centrosome disorganization, indicating that ZIKV requires CEP63 to
  disrupt centrosome organization. ZIKV infection or CEP63 loss decreased the centrosomal
  localization and stability of TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), a regulator of the innate
  immune response. ZIKV infection also increased the centrosomal accumulation of the
  CEP63 interactor DTX4, a ubiquitin ligase that degrades TBK1. Therefore, we propose
  that ZIKV disrupts CEP63 function to increase centrosomal DTX4 localization and
  destabilization of TBK1, thereby tempering the innate immune response.
