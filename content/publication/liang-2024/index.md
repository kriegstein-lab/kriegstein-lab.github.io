abstract: During development, neural stem cells in the cerebral cortex, also known
  as radial glial cells (RGCs), generate excitatory neurons, followed by production
  of cortical macroglia and inhibitory neurons that migrate to the olfactory bulb
  (OB). Understanding the mechanisms for this lineage switch is fundamental for unraveling
  how proper numbers of diverse neuronal and glial cell types are controlled. We and
  others recently showed that Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling promotes the cortical
  RGC lineage switch to generate cortical oligodendrocytes and OB interneurons. During
  this process, cortical RGCs generate intermediate progenitor cells that express
  critical gliogenesis genes Ascl1, Egfr, and Olig2. The increased Ascl1 expression
  and appearance of Egfr(+) and Olig2(+) cortical progenitors are concurrent with
  the switch from excitatory neurogenesis to gliogenesis and OB interneuron neurogenesis
  in the cortex. While Shh signaling promotes Olig2 expression in the developing spinal
  cord, the exact mechanism for this transcriptional regulation is not known. Furthermore,
  the transcriptional regulation of Olig2 and Egfr has not been explored. Here, we
  show that in cortical progenitor cells, multiple regulatory programs, including
  Pax6 and Gli3, prevent precocious expression of Olig2, a gene essential for production
  of cortical oligodendrocytes and astrocytes. We identify multiple enhancers that
  control Olig2 expression in cortical progenitors and show that the mechanisms for
  regulating Olig2 expression are conserved between the mouse and human. Our study
  reveals evolutionarily conserved regulatory logic controlling the lineage switch
  of cortical neural stem cells.
