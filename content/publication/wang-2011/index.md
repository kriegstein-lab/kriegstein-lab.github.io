abstract: A high incidence of seizures occurs during the neonatal period when immature
  networks are hyperexcitable and susceptible to hypersyncrhonous activity. During
  development, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter
  in adults, typically excites neurons due to high expression of the Na(+)-K(+)-2Cl(-)
  cotransporter (NKCC1). NKCC1 facilitates seizures because it renders GABA activity
  excitatory through intracellular Cl(-) accumulation, while blocking NKCC1 with bumetanide
  suppresses seizures. Bumetanide is currently being tested in clinical trials for
  treatment of neonatal seizures. By blocking NKCC1 with bumetanide during cortical
  development, we found a critical period for the development of alpha-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionate
  synapses. Disruption of GABA signaling during this window resulted in permanent
  decreases in excitatory synaptic transmission and sensorimotor gating deficits,
  a common feature in schizophrenia. Our study identifies an essential role for GABA-mediated
  depolarization in regulating the balance between cortical excitation and inhibition
  during a critical period and suggests a cautionary approach for using bumetanide
  in treating neonatal seizures.
