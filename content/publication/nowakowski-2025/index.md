abstract: Neurodevelopmental disorders that cause cognitive, behavioural or motor
  impairments affect around 15% of children and adolescents worldwide(1), with diagnoses
  of profound autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder increasing in the
  USA and contributing to a major economic burden(2,3). Yet the origins and mechanisms
  of these conditions remain poorly understood, limiting progress in therapies. Comprehensive
  cell atlases of the developing human brain, alongside those of model organisms such
  as mice and non-human primates, are now providing high-resolution measures of gene
  expression, cell-type abundance and spatial distribution. In this Perspective, we
  highlight recent studies that have identified novel developmental cell populations,
  revealed conserved and divergent patterns of cell genesis, migration and maturation
  across species, and begun testing hypotheses that link them to processes ranging
  from transcriptional control of cell fate specification to the emergence of complex
  behaviours. We present remaining conceptual and technical challenges and provide
  an outlook on how further studies of human and mammalian brain development can empower
  a deeper understanding of neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. Future
  efforts expanding to additional developmental stages, including adolescence, as
  well as whole-brain, multimodal and cross-species integration, will yield new insights
  into how development shapes the brain. These atlases promise to serve as essential
  references for unravelling mechanisms of brain function and disease vulnerability,
  and for advancing precision medicine.
