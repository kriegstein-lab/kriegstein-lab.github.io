abstract: Approximately 30-40% of the human genome is anchored to the nuclear lamina
  (NL) through variably sized (10 kb-10 Mb) lamina-associated domains (LADs), which
  can be classified into two subtypes (T1 and T2) based on their level of lamina-association.
  The dynamics of LAD substructure in cells that remain postmitotic for long periods
  of time are poorly understood. Here, we developed Genome Organization with CUT and
  Tag (GO-CaT) to determine the T1- and T2-LAD substructure of postmitotic excitatory
  neurons isolated from the prenatal and adult human cortex. While T1-LADs exhibited
  epigenomic features characteristic of stable, cell type-invariant LADs including
  strong transcriptional repression, in prenatal neurons, T2-LADs were enriched for
  promoter-enhancer DNA interactions, intermediate levels of gene expression, and
  genetic risk associated with neurodevelopmental and cognitive disorders. In adult
  cortical neurons, T1-LADs were expanded in size and genomic coverage, incorporating
  the majority of the prenatal T2-LADs, sequestering genes involved in neurodevelopment.
  In contrast, the minority of prenatal T2-LADs that relocated to inter-LAD regions
  in adult neurons were enriched for processes related to synaptic function. Overall,
  these data provide evidence that LADs \"mature\" in postmitotic neurons, remodeling
  from a genomic architecture that is more permissive for the dynamics of transcription
  of development to one that is more restricted and focused on the decades-long transcriptional
  needs of adult brain neurons.
