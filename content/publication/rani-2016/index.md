abstract: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a diverse and poorly conserved category
  of transcripts that have expanded greatly in primates, particularly in the brain.
  We identified an lncRNA, which has acquired 16 microRNA response elements for miR-143-3p
  in the Catarrhini branch of primates. This lncRNA, termed LncND (neurodevelopment),
  is expressed in neural progenitor cells and then declines in neurons. Binding and
  release of miR-143-3p by LncND control the expression of Notch receptors. LncND
  expression is enriched in radial glia cells (RGCs) in the ventricular and subventricular
  zones of developing human brain. Downregulation in neuroblastoma cells reduced cell
  proliferation and induced neuronal differentiation, an effect phenocopied by miR-143-3p
  overexpression. Gain of function of LncND in developing mouse cortex led to an expansion
  of PAX6+ RGCs. These findings support a role for LncND in miRNA-mediated regulation
  of Notch signaling within the neural progenitor pool in primates that may have contributed
  to the expansion of cerebral cortex.
