abstract: The cerebral cortex is the hallmark of the mammalian nervous system, and
  its large size and cellular diversity in humans support our most sophisticated cognitive
  abilities. Although the basic cellular organization of the cortex is conserved across
  mammals, cells have diversified during evolution. An increasingly integrated taxonomy
  of cell types, especially with the advent of single-cell transcriptomic data, has
  revealed an unprecedented variety of human cortical cell subtypes. Here, we broadly
  review the cellular composition and diversity of the mammalian brain, and how progenitor
  pools generate cell subtypes during development. We then discuss human cortical
  cells that are distinct from rodent cells, as well as the challenges and advantages
  of using model systems to study human cell types in health and disease.
