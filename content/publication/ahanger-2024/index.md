abstract: The nuclear genome is spatially organized into a three-dimensional (3D)
  architecture by physical association of large chromosomal domains with subnuclear
  compartments including the nuclear lamina at the radial periphery and nuclear speckles
  within the nucleoplasm(1-5). However, how spatial genome architecture regulates
  human brain development has been overlooked owing to technical limitations. Here,
  we generate high-resolution maps of genomic interactions with the lamina and speckles
  in cells of the neurogenic lineage isolated from midgestational human cortex, uncovering
  an intimate association between subnuclear genome compartmentalization, chromatin
  state and transcription. During cortical neurogenesis, spatial genome organization
  is extensively remodeled, relocating hundreds of neuronal genes from the lamina
  to speckles including key neurodevelopmental genes bivalent for H3K27me3 and H3K4me3.
  At the lamina, bivalent genes have exceptionally low expression, and relocation
  to speckles enhances resolution of bivalent chromatin to H3K4me3 and increases transcription
  >7-fold. We further demonstrate that proximity to the nuclear periphery - not the
  presence of H3K27me3 - is the dominant factor in maintaining the lowly expressed,
  poised state of bivalent genes embedded in the lamina. In addition to uncovering
  a critical role of subnuclear genome compartmentalization in neurogenic transcriptional
  regulation, our results establish a new paradigm in which knowing the spatial location
  of a gene is necessary to understanding its epigenomic regulation.
