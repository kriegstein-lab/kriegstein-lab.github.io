abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Studies of individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD)
  have revealed a strong multigenic basis with the identification of hundreds of ASD
  susceptibility genes. ASD is characterized by social deficits and a range of other
  phenotypes, implicating complex genetics and involvement of a variety of brain regions.
  However, how mutations and mis-expression of select gene sets are associated with
  the behavioral components of ASD remains unknown. We reasoned that for genes to
  be associated with ASD core behaviors they must be: (1) expressed in brain regions
  relevant to ASD social behaviors and (2) expressed during the ASD susceptible window
  of brain development. METHODS: Focusing on the amygdala, a brain region whose dysfunction
  has been highly implicated in the social component of ASD, we mined publicly available
  gene expression databases to identify ASD-susceptibility genes expressed during
  human and mouse amygdala development. We found that a large cohort of known ASD
  susceptibility genes is expressed in the developing human and mouse amygdala. We
  further performed analysis of single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) data from microdissected
  amygdala tissue from five ASD and five control human postmortem brains ranging in
  age from 4 to 20 years to elucidate cell type specificity of amygdala-expressed
  genes and their dysregulation in ASD. RESULTS: Our analyses revealed that of the
  high-ranking ASD susceptibility genes, 80 are expressed in both human and mouse
  amygdala during fetal to early postnatal stages of development. Our human snRNA-seq
  analyses revealed cohorts of genes with altered expression in the ASD amygdala postnatally,
  especially within excitatory neurons, with dysregulated expression of seven genes
  predicted from our datamining pipeline. LIMITATIONS: We were limited by the ages
  for which we were able to obtain human tissue; therefore, the results from our datamining
  pipeline approach will require validation, to the extent possible, in human tissue
  from earlier developmental stages. CONCLUSIONS: Our pipeline narrows down the number
  of amygdala-expressed genes possibly involved in the social pathophysiology of ASD.
  Our human single-nucleus gene expression analyses revealed that ASD is characterized
  by changes in gene expression in specific cell types in the early postnatal amygdala.'
