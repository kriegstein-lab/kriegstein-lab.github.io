abstract: Directed differentiation from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) has seen
  significant progress in recent years. However, most differentiated populations exhibit
  immature properties of an early embryonic stage, raising concerns about their ability
  to model and treat disease. Here, we report the directed differentiation of hPSCs
  into medial ganglionic eminence (MGE)-like progenitors and their maturation into
  forebrain type interneurons. We find that early-stage progenitors progress via a
  radial glial-like stem cell enriched in the human fetal brain. Both in vitro and
  posttransplantation into the rodent cortex, the MGE-like cells develop into GABAergic
  interneuron subtypes with mature physiological properties along a prolonged intrinsic
  timeline of up to 7 months, mimicking endogenous human neural development. MGE-derived
  cortical interneuron deficiencies are implicated in a broad range of neurodevelopmental
  and degenerative disorders, highlighting the importance of these results for modeling
  human neural development and disease.
