abstract: Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD) is an X-linked leukodystrophy caused
  by mutations in Proteolipid Protein 1 (PLP1), encoding a major myelin protein, resulting
  in profound developmental delay and early lethality. Previous work showed involvement
  of unfolded protein response (UPR) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathways,
  but poor PLP1 genotype-phenotype associations suggest additional pathogenetic mechanisms.
  Using induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) and gene-correction, we show that patient-derived
  oligodendrocytes can develop to the pre-myelinating stage, but subsequently undergo
  cell death. Mutant oligodendrocytes demonstrated key hallmarks of ferroptosis including
  lipid peroxidation, abnormal iron metabolism, and hypersensitivity to free iron.
  Iron chelation rescued mutant oligodendrocyte apoptosis, survival, and differentiationin
  vitro, and post-transplantation in vivo. Finally, systemic treatment of Plp1 mutant
  Jimpy mice with deferiprone, a small molecule iron chelator, reduced oligodendrocyte
  apoptosis and enabled myelin formation. Thus, oligodendrocyte iron-induced cell
  death and myelination is rescued by iron chelation in PMD pre-clinical models.
