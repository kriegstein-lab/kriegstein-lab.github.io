abstract: Evolutionary expansion of the human neocortex underlies many of our unique
  mental abilities. This expansion has been attributed to the increased proliferative
  potential of radial glia (RG; neural stem cells) and their subventricular dispersion
  from the periventricular niche during neocortical development. Such adaptations
  may have evolved through gene expression changes in RG. However, whether or how
  RG gene expression varies between humans and other species is unknown. Here we show
  that the transcriptional profiles of human and mouse neocortical RG are broadly
  conserved during neurogenesis, yet diverge for specific signalling pathways. By
  analysing differential gene co-expression relationships between the species, we
  demonstrate that the growth factor PDGFD is specifically expressed by RG in human,
  but not mouse, corticogenesis. We also show that the expression domain of PDGFRbeta,
  the cognate receptor for PDGFD, is evolutionarily divergent, with high expression
  in the germinal region of dorsal human neocortex but not in the mouse. Pharmacological
  inhibition of PDGFD-PDGFRbeta signalling in slice culture prevents normal cell cycle
  progression of neocortical RG in human, but not mouse. Conversely, injection of
  recombinant PDGFD or ectopic expression of constitutively active PDGFRbeta in developing
  mouse neocortex increases the proportion of RG and their subventricular dispersion.
  These findings highlight the requirement of PDGFD-PDGFRbeta signalling for human
  neocortical development and suggest that local production of growth factors by RG
  supports the expanded germinal region and progenitor heterogeneity of species with
  large brains.
