abstract: The vasculature of the central nervous system is a 3D lattice composed of
  laminar vascular beds interconnected by penetrating vessels. The mechanisms controlling
  3D lattice network formation remain largely unknown. Combining viral labeling, genetic
  marking, and single-cell profiling in the mouse retina, we discovered a perivascular
  neuronal subset, annotated as Fam19a4/Nts-positive retinal ganglion cells (Fam19a4/Nts-RGCs),
  directly contacting the vasculature with perisomatic endfeet. Developmental ablation
  of Fam19a4/Nts-RGCs led to disoriented growth of penetrating vessels near the ganglion
  cell layer (GCL), leading to a disorganized 3D vascular lattice. We identified enriched
  PIEZO2 expression in Fam19a4/Nts-RGCs. Piezo2 loss from all retinal neurons or Fam19a4/Nts-RGCs
  abolished the direct neurovascular contacts and phenocopied the Fam19a4/Nts-RGC
  ablation deficits. The defective vascular structure led to reduced capillary perfusion
  and sensitized the retina to ischemic insults. Furthermore, we uncovered a Piezo2-dependent
  perivascular granule cell subset for cerebellar vascular patterning, indicating
  neuronal Piezo2-dependent 3D vascular patterning in the brain.
