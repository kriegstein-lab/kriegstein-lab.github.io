abstract: Innovations in organoid-based models of human tissues have made them an
  exciting experimental platform for studying development and disease. However, these
  models require systematic benchmarking against primary tissue to establish their
  value. We discuss key parameters that impact the utility of organoid models, primarily
  focusing on cerebral organoids as examples.
