abstract: We analyzed >700,000 single-nucleus RNA sequencing profiles from 106 donors
  during prenatal and postnatal developmental stages and identified lineage-specific
  programs that underlie the development of specific subtypes of excitatory cortical
  neurons, interneurons, glial cell types, and brain vasculature. By leveraging single-nucleus
  chromatin accessibility data, we delineated enhancer gene regulatory networks and
  transcription factors that control commitment of specific cortical lineages. By
  intersecting our results with genetic risk factors for human brain diseases, we
  identified the cortical cell types and lineages most vulnerable to genetic insults
  of different brain disorders, especially autism. We find that lineage-specific gene
  expression programs up-regulated in female cells are especially enriched for the
  genetic risk factors of autism. Our study captures the molecular progression of
  cortical lineages across human development.
