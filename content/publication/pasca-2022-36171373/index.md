abstract: "Self-organizing three-dimensional cellular models derived from human pluripotent stem cells or primary tissue have great potential to provide insights into how the human nervous system develops, what makes it unique and how disorders of the nervous system arise, progress and could be treated. Here, to facilitate progress and improve communication with the scientific community and the public, we clarify and provide a basic framework for the nomenclature of human multicellular models of nervous system development and disease, including organoids, assembloids and transplants."
