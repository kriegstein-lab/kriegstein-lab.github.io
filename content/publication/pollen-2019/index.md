abstract: 'Direct comparisons of human and non-human primate brains can reveal molecular
  pathways underlying remarkable specializations of the human brain. However, chimpanzee
  tissue is inaccessible during neocortical neurogenesis when differences in brain
  size first appear. To identify human-specific features of cortical development,
  we leveraged recent innovations that permit generating pluripotent stem cell-derived
  cerebral organoids from chimpanzee. Despite metabolic differences, organoid models
  preserve gene regulatory networks related to primary cell types and developmental
  processes. We further identified 261 differentially expressed genes in human compared
  to both chimpanzee organoids and macaque cortex, enriched for recent gene duplications,
  and including multiple regulators of PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling. We observed increased
  activation of this pathway in human radial glia, dependent on two receptors upregulated
  specifically in human: INSR and ITGB8. Our findings establish a platform for systematic
  analysis of molecular changes contributing to human brain development and evolution.'
