abstract: Lineage-specific epigenomic changes during human corticogenesis have been
  difficult to study owing to challenges with sample availability and tissue heterogeneity.
  For example, previous studies using single-cell RNA sequencing identified at least
  9 major cell types and up to 26 distinct subtypes in the dorsal cortex alone(1,2).
  Here we characterize cell-type-specific cis-regulatory chromatin interactions, open
  chromatin peaks, and transcriptomes for radial glia, intermediate progenitor cells,
  excitatory neurons, and interneurons isolated from mid-gestational samples of the
  human cortex. We show that chromatin interactions underlie several aspects of gene
  regulation, with transposable elements and disease-associated variants enriched
  at distal interacting regions in a cell-type-specific manner. In addition, promoters
  with increased levels of chromatin interactivity-termed super-interactive promoters-are
  enriched for lineage-specific genes, suggesting that interactions at these loci
  contribute to the fine-tuning of transcription. Finally, we develop CRISPRview,
  a technique that integrates immunostaining, CRISPR interference, RNAscope, and image
  analysis to validate cell-type-specific cis-regulatory elements in heterogeneous
  populations of primary cells. Our findings provide insights into cell-type-specific
  gene expression patterns in the developing human cortex and advance our understanding
  of gene regulation and lineage specification during this crucial developmental window.
