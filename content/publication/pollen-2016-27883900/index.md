abstract: "Sensory experience evokes long-lasting changes in neural circuits through activity-dependent gene expression. Ataman et al. (2016) report in Nature that primates evolved novel transcriptional responses to neuronal activity, including induction of musclin/osteocrin (OSTN), which may regulate specialized aspects of primate neural circuits."
