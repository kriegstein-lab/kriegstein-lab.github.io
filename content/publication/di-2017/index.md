abstract: Understanding the development and dysfunction of the human brain is a major
  goal of neurobiology. Much of our current understanding of human brain development
  has been derived from the examination of post-mortem and pathological specimens,
  bolstered by observations of developing non-human primates and experimental studies
  focused largely on mouse models. However, these tissue specimens and model systems
  cannot fully capture the unique and dynamic features of human brain development.
  Recent advances in stem cell technologies that enable the generation of human brain
  organoids from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) promise to profoundly change our understanding
  of the development of the human brain and enable a detailed study of the pathogenesis
  of inherited and acquired brain diseases.
