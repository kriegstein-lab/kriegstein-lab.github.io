abstract: Genetic changes causing brain size expansion in human evolution have remained
  elusive. Notch signaling is essential for radial glia stem cell proliferation and
  is a determinant of neuronal number in the mammalian cortex. We find that three
  paralogs of human-specific NOTCH2NL are highly expressed in radial glia. Functional
  analysis reveals that different alleles of NOTCH2NL have varying potencies to enhance
  Notch signaling by interacting directly with NOTCH receptors. Consistent with a
  role in Notch signaling, NOTCH2NL ectopic expression delays differentiation of neuronal
  progenitors, while deletion accelerates differentiation into cortical neurons. Furthermore,
  NOTCH2NL genes provide the breakpoints in 1q21.1 distal deletion/duplication syndrome,
  where duplications are associated with macrocephaly and autism and deletions with
  microcephaly and schizophrenia. Thus, the emergence of human-specific NOTCH2NL genes
  may have contributed to the rapid evolution of the larger human neocortex, accompanied
  by loss of genomic stability at the 1q21.1 locus and resulting recurrent neurodevelopmental
  disorders.
