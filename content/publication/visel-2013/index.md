abstract: The mammalian telencephalon plays critical roles in cognition, motor function,
  and emotion. Though many of the genes required for its development have been identified,
  the distant-acting regulatory sequences orchestrating their in vivo expression are
  mostly unknown. Here, we describe a digital atlas of in vivo enhancers active in
  subregions of the developing telencephalon. We identified more than 4,600 candidate
  embryonic forebrain enhancers and studied the in vivo activity of 329 of these sequences
  in transgenic mouse embryos. We generated serial sets of histological brain sections
  for 145 reproducible forebrain enhancers, resulting in a publicly accessible web-based
  data collection comprising more than 32,000 sections. We also used epigenomic analysis
  of human and mouse cortex tissue to directly compare the genome-wide enhancer architecture
  in these species. These data provide a primary resource for investigating gene regulatory
  mechanisms of telencephalon development and enable studies of the role of distant-acting
  enhancers in neurodevelopmental disorders.
