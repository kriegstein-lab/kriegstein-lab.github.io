abstract: Recent work suggests that radial glial cells represent many, if not most,
  of the neuronal progenitors in the developing cortex. Asymmetric cell division of
  radial glia results in the self-renewal of the radial glial cell and the birth of
  a neuron. Among the proteins that direct cell fate in Drosophila melanogaster that
  have known mammalian homologs, Numb is the best candidate to have a similar function
  in radial glia. During asymmetric divisions of radial glial cells, the basal cell
  may inherit the radial glial fibre, while the apical cell sequesters the majority
  of the Numb protein. We suggest two models that make opposite predictions as to
  whether the radial glia or nascent neuron inherit the radial glial fiber or the
  majority of the Numb protein.
