abstract: Glycine and gamma-aminobutyric acid, type A (GABA(A)) receptors are members
  of the ligand-gated ion channel superfamily that mediate inhibitory synaptic transmission
  in the adult central nervous system. During development, the activation of these
  receptors leads to membrane depolarization. Ligands for the two receptors have important
  implications both in disease therapy and as pharmacological tools. Terpene trilactones
  (ginkgolides and bilobalide) are unique constituents of Ginkgo biloba extracts that
  have various effects on the central nervous system. We have investigated the relative
  potency of these compounds on glycine and GABA(A) receptors. We find that most of
  the ginkgolides are selective and potent antagonists of the glycine receptor. Bilobalide,
  the single major component in G. biloba extracts, also reduces glycine-induced currents,
  although to a lesser extent. Both ginkgolides and bilobalide inhibit GABA(A) receptors,
  with bilobalide demonstrating a more potent effect. Additionally, we provide evidence
  that open channels are required for glycine receptor inhibition by ginkgolides.
  Finally, we employ molecular modeling to elucidate the similarities and differences
  in the structure of the terpene trilactones to account for the pharmacological properties
  of these compounds and demonstrate a striking similarity between ginkgolides and
  picrotoxinin, a GABA(A) and recombinant glycine alpha-homomeric receptor antagonist.
