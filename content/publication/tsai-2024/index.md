abstract: Diverse retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) transmit distinct visual features
  from the eye to the brain. Recent studies have categorized RGCs into 45 types in
  mice based on transcriptomic profiles, showing strong alignment with morphological
  and electrophysiological properties. However, little is known about how these types
  are spatially arranged on the two-dimensional retinal surface-an organization that
  influences visual encoding-and how their local microenvironments impact development
  and neurodegenerative responses. To address this gap, we optimized a workflow combining
  imaging-based spatial transcriptomics (MERFISH) and immunohistochemical co-staining
  on thin flatmount retinal sections. We used computational methods to register en
  face somata distributions of all molecularly defined RGC types. More than 75% (34/45)
  of types exhibited non-uniform distributions, likely reflecting adaptations of the
  retina's anatomy to the animal's visual environment. By analyzing the local neighborhoods
  of each cell, we identified perivascular RGCs located near blood vessels. Seven
  RGC types are enriched in the perivascular niche, including members of intrinsically
  photosensitive RGC (ipRGC) and direction-selective RGC (DSGC) subclasses. Orthologous
  human RGC counterparts of perivascular types - Melanopsin-enriched ipRGCs and ON
  DSGCs - were also proximal to blood vessels, suggesting their perivascularity may
  be evolutionarily conserved. Following optic nerve crush in mice, the perivascular
  M1-ipRGCs and ON DSGCs showed preferential survival, suggesting that proximity to
  blood vessels may render cell-extrinsic neuroprotection to RGCs through an mTOR-independent
  mechanism. Overall, our work offers a resource characterizing the spatial profiles
  of RGC types, enabling future studies of retinal development, physiology, and neurodegeneration
  at individual neuron type resolution across the two-dimensional space.
