abstract: The development of the human neocortex is highly dynamic, involving complex
  cellular trajectories controlled by gene regulation(1). Here we collected paired
  single-nucleus chromatin accessibility and transcriptome data from 38 human neocortical
  samples encompassing both the prefrontal cortex and the primary visual cortex. These
  samples span five main developmental stages, ranging from the first trimester to
  adolescence. In parallel, we performed spatial transcriptomic analysis on a subset
  of the samples to illustrate spatial organization and intercellular communication.
  This atlas enables us to catalogue cell-type-specific, age-specific and area-specific
  gene regulatory networks underlying neural differentiation. Moreover, combining
  single-cell profiling, progenitor purification and lineage-tracing experiments,
  we have untangled the complex lineage relationships among progenitor subtypes during
  the neurogenesis-to-gliogenesis transition. We identified a tripotential intermediate
  progenitor subtype-tripotential intermediate progenitor cells (Tri-IPCs)-that is
  responsible for the local production of GABAergic neurons, oligodendrocyte precursor
  cells and astrocytes. Notably, most glioblastoma cells resemble Tri-IPCs at the
  transcriptomic level, suggesting that cancer cells hijack developmental processes
  to enhance growth and heterogeneity. Furthermore, by integrating our atlas data
  with large-scale genome-wide association study data, we created a disease-risk map
  highlighting enriched risk associated with autism spectrum disorder in second-trimester
  intratelencephalic neurons. Our study sheds light on the molecular and cellular
  dynamics of the developing human neocortex.
