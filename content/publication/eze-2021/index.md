abstract: The human cortex comprises diverse cell types that emerge from an initially
  uniform neuroepithelium that gives rise to radial glia, the neural stem cells of
  the cortex. To characterize the earliest stages of human brain development, we performed
  single-cell RNA-sequencing across regions of the developing human brain, including
  the telencephalon, diencephalon, midbrain, hindbrain and cerebellum. We identify
  nine progenitor populations physically proximal to the telencephalon, suggesting
  more heterogeneity than previously described, including a highly prevalent mesenchymal-like
  population that disappears once neurogenesis begins. Comparison of human and mouse
  progenitor populations at corresponding stages identifies two progenitor clusters
  that are enriched in the early stages of human cortical development. We also find
  that organoid systems display low fidelity to neuroepithelial and early radial glia
  cell types, but improve as neurogenesis progresses. Overall, we provide a comprehensive
  molecular and spatial atlas of early stages of human brain and cortical development.
