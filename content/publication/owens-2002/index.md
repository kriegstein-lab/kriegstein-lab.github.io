abstract: In the mature brain, GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) functions primarily
  as an inhibitory neurotransmitter. But it can also act as a trophic factor during
  nervous system development to influence events such as proliferation, migration,
  differentiation, synapse maturation and cell death. GABA mediates these processes
  by the activation of traditional ionotropic and metabotropic receptors, and probably
  by both synaptic and non-synaptic mechanisms. However, the functional properties
  of GABA receptor signalling in the immature brain are significantly different from,
  and in some ways opposite to, those found in the adult brain. The unique features
  of the early-appearing GABA signalling systems might help to explain how GABA acts
  as a developmental signal.
