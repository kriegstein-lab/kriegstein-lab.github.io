abstract: Neuroserpin is a serine-protease inhibitor mainly expressed in the CNS and
  involved in the inhibition of the proteolytic cascade. Animal models confirmed its
  neuroprotective role in perinatal hypoxia-ischaemia and adult stroke. Although neuroserpin
  may be a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of the aforementioned conditions,
  there is still no information in the literature on its distribution during human
  brain development. The present study provides a detailed description of the changing
  spatiotemporal patterns of neuroserpin focusing on physiological human brain development.
  Five stages were distinguished within our examined age range which spanned from
  the 7th gestational week until adulthood. In particular, subplate and deep cortical
  plate neurons were identified as the main sources of neuroserpin production between
  the 25th gestational week and the first postnatal month. Our immunohistochemical
  findings were substantiated by single cell RNA sequencing data showing specific
  neuronal and glial cell types expressing neuroserpin. The characterization of neuroserpin
  expression during physiological human brain development is essential for forthcoming
  studies which will explore its involvement in pathological conditions, such as perinatal
  hypoxia-ischaemia and adult stroke in human.
