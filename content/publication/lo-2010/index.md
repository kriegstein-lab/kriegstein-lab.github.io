abstract: The use of iPSCs and tetraploid complementation for human reproductive cloning
  would raise profound ethical objections. Professional standards and laws that ban
  human reproductive cloning by somatic cell nuclear transfer should be revised to
  also forbid it by other methods, such as iPSCs via tetraploid complementation.
