abstract: Chronic neurodegeneration and acute injuries lead to neuron losses via diverse
  processes. We compared retinal ganglion cell (RGC) responses between chronic glaucomatous
  conditions and the acute injury model. Among major RGC subclasses, alphaRGCs and
  intrinsically photosensitive RGCs (ipRGCs) preferentially survive glaucomatous conditions,
  similar to findings in the retina subject to axotomy. Focusing on an alphaRGC intrinsic
  factor, Osteopontin (secreted phosphoprotein 1 [Spp1]), we found an ectopic neuronal
  expression of Osteopontin (Spp1) in other RGCs subject to glaucomatous conditions.
  This contrasted with the Spp1 downregulation subject to axotomy. alphaRGC-specific
  Spp1 elimination led to significant alphaRGC loss, diminishing their resiliency.
  Spp1 overexpression led to robust neuroprotection of susceptible RGC subclasses
  under glaucomatous conditions. In contrast, Spp1 overexpression did not significantly
  protect RGCs subject to axotomy. Additionally, SPP1 marked adult human RGC subsets
  with large somata and SPP1 expression in the aqueous humor correlated with glaucoma
  severity. Our study reveals Spp1's role in mediating neuronal resiliency in glaucoma.
