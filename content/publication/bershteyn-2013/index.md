abstract: A three-dimensional culture of cortical tissues derived from pluripotent
  stem cells offers an opportunity to model human brain development and disorders.
  In a recent issue of Nature, Lancaster et al. describe a new method for generating
  cerebral organoids in a dish and use it to model microcephaly.
