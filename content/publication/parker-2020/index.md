abstract: CD19-directed immunotherapies are clinically effective for treating B cell
  malignancies but also cause a high incidence of neurotoxicity. A subset of patients
  treated with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells or bispecific T cell engager
  (BiTE) antibodies display severe neurotoxicity, including fatal cerebral edema associated
  with T cell infiltration into the brain. Here, we report that mural cells, which
  surround the endothelium and are critical for blood-brain-barrier integrity, express
  CD19. We identify CD19 expression in brain mural cells using single-cell RNA sequencing
  data and confirm perivascular staining at the protein level. CD19 expression in
  the brain begins early in development alongside the emergence of mural cell lineages
  and persists throughout adulthood across brain regions. Mouse mural cells demonstrate
  lower levels of Cd19 expression, suggesting limitations in preclinical animal models
  of neurotoxicity. These data suggest an on-target mechanism for neurotoxicity in
  CD19-directed therapies and highlight the utility of human single-cell atlases for
  designing immunotherapies.
