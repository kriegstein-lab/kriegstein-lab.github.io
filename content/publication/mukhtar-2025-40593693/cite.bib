  abstract = {Prenatal nicotine exposure impairs fetal cortical grey matter volume, but the precise cellular mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study elucidates the role of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in progenitor cells and radial glia (RG) during human cortical development. We identify two nAChR subunits-CHRNA7 and the human-specific CHRFAM7A-expressed in SOX2+ progenitors and neurons, with CHRFAM7A particularly enriched along RG endfeet. nAChR activation in organotypic slices and dissociated cultures increases RG proliferation while decreasing neuronal differentiation, whereas nAChR knockdown reduces RG and increases neurons. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals that nicotine exposure downregulates key genes in excitatory neurons (ENs), with CHRNA7 or CHRFAM7A selectively modulating these changes, suggesting an evolutionary divergence in regulatory pathways. Furthermore, we identify YAP1 as a critical downstream effector of nAChR signaling, and inhibiting YAP1 reverses nicotine-induced phenotypic alterations in oRG cells, highlighting its role in nicotine-induced neurodevelopmental pathophysiology.},
