  abstract = {Innovations in organoid-based models of human tissues have made them an exciting experimental platform for studying development and disease. However, these models require systematic benchmarking against primary tissue to establish their value. We discuss key parameters that impact the utility of organoid models, primarily focusing on cerebral organoids as examples.},
