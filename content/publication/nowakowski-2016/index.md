abstract: The classic view of cortical development, embodied in the radial unit hypothesis,
  highlights the ventricular radial glia (vRG) scaffold as a key architectonic feature
  of the developing neocortex. The scaffold includes continuous fibers spanning the
  thickness of the developing cortex during neurogenesis across mammals. However,
  we find that in humans, the scaffold transforms into a physically discontinuous
  structure during the transition from infragranular to supragranular neuron production.
  As a consequence of this transformation, supragranular layer neurons arrive at their
  terminal positions in the cortical plate along outer radial glia (oRG) cell fibers.
  In parallel, the radial glia that contact the ventricle develop distinct gene expression
  profile and \"truncated\" morphology. We propose a supragranular layer expansion
  hypothesis that posits a deterministic role of oRG cells in the radial and tangential
  expansion of supragranular layers in primates, with implications for patterns of
  neuronal migration, area patterning, and cortical folding.
