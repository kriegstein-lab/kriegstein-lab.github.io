abstract: Germline genetic architecture of Alzheimer's disease (AD) indicates microglial
  mechanisms of disease susceptibility and outcomes. However, the mechanisms that
  enable microglia to mediate protective responses to AD pathology remain elusive.
  Adgrg1 is specifically expressed in yolk-sac-derived microglia. This study reveals
  the role of yolk-sac-derived microglia in AD pathology, highlighting the function
  of ADGRG1 in modulating microglial protective responses to amyloid deposition. Utilizing
  both constitutive and inducible microglial Adgrg1 knockout 5xFAD models, we demonstrate
  that Adgrg1 deficiency leads to increased amyloid deposition, exacerbated neuropathology,
  and accelerated cognitive impairment. Transcriptomic analyses reveal a distinct
  microglial state characterized by downregulated genes associated with homeostasis,
  phagocytosis, and lysosomal functions. Functional assays in mouse models and human
  embryonic stem cells-derived microglia support that microglial ADGRG1 is required
  for efficient Abeta phagocytosis. Together, these results uncover a GPCR-dependent
  microglial response to Abeta, pointing towards potential therapeutic strategies
  to alleviate disease progression by enhancing microglial functional competence.
