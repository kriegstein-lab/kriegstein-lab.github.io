abstract: The dramatic evolutionary expansion of the cerebral cortex of Homo sapiens
  underlies our unique higher cortical functions, and therefore bears on the ultimate
  issue of what makes us human. Recent insights into developmental events during early
  proliferative stages of cortical development indicate how neural stem and progenitor
  cells might interact to produce cortical expansion during development, and could
  shed light on evolutionary changes in cortical structure.
