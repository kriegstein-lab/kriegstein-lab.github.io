abstract: GABAergic cortical interneurons underlie the complexity of neural circuits
  and are particularly numerous and diverse in humans. In rodents, cortical interneurons
  originate in the subpallial ganglionic eminences, but their developmental origins
  in humans are controversial. We characterized the developing human ganglionic eminences
  and found that the subventricular zone (SVZ) expanded massively during the early
  second trimester, becoming densely populated with neural stem cells and intermediate
  progenitor cells. In contrast with the cortex, most stem cells in the ganglionic
  eminence SVZ did not maintain radial fibers or orientation. The medial ganglionic
  eminence exhibited unique patterns of progenitor cell organization and clustering,
  and markers revealed that the caudal ganglionic eminence generated a greater proportion
  of cortical interneurons in humans than in rodents. On the basis of labeling of
  newborn neurons in slice culture and mapping of proliferating interneuron progenitors,
  we conclude that the vast majority of human cortical interneurons are produced in
  the ganglionic eminences, including an enormous contribution from non-epithelial
  SVZ stem cells.
