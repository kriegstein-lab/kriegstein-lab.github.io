  abstract = {Our knowledge of the proliferation, migration, and differentiation of neurons has changed dramatically over the last 10 years. Whereas traditionally it was thought that glial and neuronal cells were separate cell lines with different lineages, we now know that this is not true. Radial glia are a type of neural stem cell that generate excitatory pyramidal neurons directly through asymmetric cell division in the ventricular zone (VZ) of the telencephalon and indirectly through the symmetric division of daughter intermediate precursor cells that divide in the subventricular zone (SVZ). Moreover, pyramidal neurons, once thought to migrate only along radial guide fibers to the developing layers of the cortex, have been shown to proceed through four distinct stages of migration during which they change shape, direction, and speed. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABAergic) inhibitory interneurons, on the other hand, are generated not in the cortex, but in the medial ganglionic eminence and migrate tangentially to their final cortical destinations. Evidence suggests that GABA activation may play a role in coordinating the generation and migration of both pyramidal and interneuron populations. At the end of neurogenesis, radial glial cells translocate to the cortex and transform into astrocytes. Although they do not actively divide in the adult brain, astrocytes may retain the potential to generate new neurons. These new findings have increased our understanding of the mechanisms underlying certain developmental disorders and, in doing so, reveal potentially useful modes of therapeutic intervention.},
