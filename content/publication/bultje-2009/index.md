abstract: Asymmetric cell division of radial glial progenitors produces neurons while
  allowing self-renewal; however, little is known about the mechanism that generates
  asymmetry in daughter cell fate specification. Here, we found that mammalian partition
  defective protein 3 (mPar3), a key cell polarity determinant, exhibits dynamic distribution
  in radial glial progenitors. While it is enriched at the lateral membrane domain
  in the ventricular endfeet during interphase, mPar3 becomes dispersed and shows
  asymmetric localization as cell cycle progresses. Either removal or ectopic expression
  of mPar3 prevents radial glial progenitors from dividing asymmetrically yet generates
  different outcomes in daughter cell fate specification. Furthermore, the expression
  level of mPar3 affects Notch signaling, and manipulations of Notch signaling or
  Numb expression suppress mPar3 regulation of radial glial cell division and daughter
  cell fate specification. These results reveal a critical molecular pathway underlying
  asymmetric cell division of radial glial progenitors in the mammalian neocortex.
