abstract: Duplication 15q (dup15q) syndrome is a leading genetic cause of autism spectrum
  disorder, offering a key model for studying autism-related mechanisms. Using single-cell
  and single-nucleus RNA sequencing of cortical organoids from dup15q patient-derived
  iPSCs and post-mortem brain samples, we identify increased glycolysis, disrupted
  layer-specific marker expression, and aberrant morphology in deep-layer neurons
  during fetal-stage organoid development. In adolescent-adult postmortem brains,
  upper-layer neurons exhibit heightened transcriptional burden related to synaptic
  signaling, a pattern shared with idiopathic autism. Using spatial transcriptomics,
  we confirm these cell-type-specific disruptions in brain tissue. By gene co-expression
  network analysis, we reveal disease-associated modules that are well preserved between
  postmortem and organoid samples, suggesting metabolic dysregulation that may lead
  to altered neuron projection, synaptic dysfunction, and neuron hyperexcitability
  in dup15q syndrome.
