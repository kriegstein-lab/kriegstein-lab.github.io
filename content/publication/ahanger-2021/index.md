abstract: Nuclear compartments are thought to play a role in three-dimensional genome
  organization and gene expression. In mammalian brain, the architecture and dynamics
  of nuclear compartment-associated genome organization is not known. In this study,
  we developed Genome Organization using CUT and RUN Technology (GO-CaRT) to map genomic
  interactions with two nuclear compartments-the nuclear lamina and nuclear speckles-from
  different regions of the developing mouse, macaque and human brain. Lamina-associated
  domain (LAD) architecture in cells in vivo is distinct from that of cultured cells,
  including major differences in LADs previously considered to be cell type invariant.
  In the mouse and human forebrain, dorsal and ventral neural precursor cells have
  differences in LAD architecture that correspond to their regional identity. LADs
  in the human and mouse cortex contain transcriptionally highly active sub-domains
  characterized by broad depletion of histone-3-lysine-9 dimethylation. Evolutionarily
  conserved LADs in human, macaque and mouse brain are enriched for transcriptionally
  active neural genes associated with synapse function. By integrating GO-CaRT maps
  with genome-wide association study data, we found speckle-associated domains to
  be enriched for schizophrenia risk loci, indicating a physical relationship between
  these disease-associated genetic variants and a specific nuclear structure. Our
  work provides a framework for understanding the relationship between distinct nuclear
  compartments and genome function in brain development and disease.
