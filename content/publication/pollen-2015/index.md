abstract: 'Radial glia, the neural stem cells of the neocortex, are located in two
  niches: the ventricular zone and outer subventricular zone. Although outer subventricular
  zone radial glia may generate the majority of human cortical neurons, their molecular
  features remain elusive. By analyzing gene expression across single cells, we find
  that outer radial glia preferentially express genes related to extracellular matrix
  formation, migration, and stemness, including TNC, PTPRZ1, FAM107A, HOPX, and LIFR.
  Using dynamic imaging, immunostaining, and clonal analysis, we relate these molecular
  features to distinctive behaviors of outer radial glia, demonstrate the necessity
  of STAT3 signaling for their cell cycle progression, and establish their extensive
  proliferative potential. These results suggest that outer radial glia directly support
  the subventricular niche through local production of growth factors, potentiation
  of growth factor signals by extracellular matrix proteins, and activation of self-renewal
  pathways, thereby enabling the developmental and evolutionary expansion of the human
  neocortex.'
