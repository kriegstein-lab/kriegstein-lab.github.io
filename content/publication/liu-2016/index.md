abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) comprise a diverse class of
  transcripts that can regulate molecular and cellular processes in brain development
  and disease. LncRNAs exhibit cell type- and tissue-specific expression, but little
  is known about the expression and function of lncRNAs in the developing human brain.
  Furthermore, it has been unclear whether lncRNAs are highly expressed in subsets
  of cells within tissues, despite appearing lowly expressed in bulk populations.
  RESULTS: We use strand-specific RNA-seq to deeply profile lncRNAs from polyadenylated
  and total RNA obtained from human neocortex at different stages of development,
  and we apply this reference to analyze the transcriptomes of single cells. While
  lncRNAs are generally detected at low levels in bulk tissues, single-cell transcriptomics
  of hundreds of neocortex cells reveal that many lncRNAs are abundantly expressed
  in individual cells and are cell type-specific. Notably, LOC646329 is a lncRNA enriched
  in single radial glia cells but is detected at low abundance in tissues. CRISPRi
  knockdown of LOC646329 indicates that this lncRNA regulates cell proliferation.
  CONCLUSION: The discrete and abundant expression of lncRNAs among individual cells
  has important implications for both their biological function and utility for distinguishing
  neural cell types.'
