abstract: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) readily
  infects a variety of cell types impacting the function of vital organ systems, with
  particularly severe impact on respiratory function. It proves fatal for one percent
  of those infected. Neurological symptoms, which range in severity, accompany a significant
  proportion of COVID-19 cases, indicating a potential vulnerability of neural cell
  types. To assess whether human cortical cells can be directly infected by SARS-CoV-2,
  we utilized primary human cortical tissue and stem cell-derived cortical organoids.
  We find significant and predominant infection in cortical astrocytes in both primary
  and organoid cultures, with minimal infection of other cortical populations. Infected
  astrocytes had a corresponding increase in reactivity characteristics, growth factor
  signaling, and cellular stress. Although human cortical cells, including astrocytes,
  have minimal ACE2 expression, we find high levels of alternative coronavirus receptors
  in infected astrocytes, including DPP4 and CD147. Inhibition of DPP4 reduced infection
  and decreased expression of the cell stress marker, ARCN1. We find tropism of SARS-CoV-2
  for human astrocytes mediated by DPP4, resulting in reactive gliosis-type injury.
