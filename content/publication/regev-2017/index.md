abstract: The recent advent of methods for high-throughput single-cell molecular profiling
  has catalyzed a growing sense in the scientific community that the time is ripe
  to complete the 150-year-old effort to identify all cell types in the human body.
  The Human Cell Atlas Project is an international collaborative effort that aims
  to define all human cell types in terms of distinctive molecular profiles (such
  as gene expression profiles) and to connect this information with classical cellular
  descriptions (such as location and morphology). An open comprehensive reference
  map of the molecular state of cells in healthy human tissues would propel the systematic
  study of physiological states, developmental trajectories, regulatory circuitry
  and interactions of cells, and also provide a framework for understanding cellular
  dysregulation in human disease. Here we describe the idea, its potential utility,
  early proofs-of-concept, and some design considerations for the Human Cell Atlas,
  including a commitment to open data, code, and community.
