abstract: Mutations in the human LIS1 gene cause the smooth brain disease classical
  lissencephaly. To understand the underlying mechanisms, we conducted in situ live
  cell imaging analysis of LIS1 function throughout the entire radial migration pathway.
  In utero electroporation of LIS1 small interference RNA and short hairpin dominant
  negative LIS1 and dynactin cDNAs caused a dramatic accumulation of multipolar progenitor
  cells within the subventricular zone of embryonic rat brains. This effect resulted
  from a complete failure in progression from the multipolar to the migratory bipolar
  state, as revealed by time-lapse analysis of brain slices. Surprisingly, interkinetic
  nuclear oscillations in the radial glial progenitors were also abolished, as were
  cell divisions at the ventricular surface. Those few bipolar cells that reached
  the intermediate zone also exhibited a complete block in somal translocation, although,
  remarkably, process extension persisted. Finally, axonal growth also ceased. These
  results identify multiple distinct and novel roles for LIS1 in nucleokinesis and
  process dynamics and suggest that nuclear position controls neural progenitor cell
  division.
