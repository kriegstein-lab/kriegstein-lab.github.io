abstract: Germinal matrix hemorrhage (GMH) is a devastating neurodevelopmental condition
  affecting preterm infants, but why blood vessels in this brain region are vulnerable
  to rupture remains unknown. Here we show that microglia in prenatal mouse and human
  brain interact with nascent vasculature in an age-dependent manner and that ablation
  of these cells in mice reduces angiogenesis in the ganglionic eminences, which correspond
  to the human germinal matrix. Consistent with these findings, single-cell transcriptomics
  and flow cytometry show that distinct subsets of CD45(+) cells from control preterm
  infants employ diverse signaling mechanisms to promote vascular network formation.
  In contrast, CD45(+) cells from infants with GMH harbor activated neutrophils and
  monocytes that produce proinflammatory factors, including azurocidin 1, elastase
  and CXCL16, to disrupt vascular integrity and cause hemorrhage in ganglionic eminences.
  These results underscore the brain's innate immune cells in region-specific angiogenesis
  and how aberrant activation of these immune cells promotes GMH in preterm infants.
