abstract: 'Analysis of the composition of heterogeneous tissue has been greatly enabled
  by recent developments in single-cell transcriptomics. We present SCell, an integrated
  software tool for quality filtering, normalization, feature selection, iterative
  dimensionality reduction, clustering and the estimation of gene-expression gradients
  from large ensembles of single-cell RNA-seq datasets. SCell is open source, and
  implemented with an intuitive graphical interface. Scripts and protocols for the
  high-throughput pre-processing of large ensembles of single-cell, RNA-seq datasets
  are provided as an additional resource. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Binary
  executables for Windows, MacOS and Linux are available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/scell,
  source code and pre-processing scripts are available from https://github.com/diazlab/SCellSupplementary
  information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online. CONTACT:
