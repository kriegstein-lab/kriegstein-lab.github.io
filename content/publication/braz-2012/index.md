abstract: Neuropathic pain is a chronic debilitating disease characterized by mechanical
  allodynia and spontaneous pain. Because symptoms are often unresponsive to conventional
  methods of pain treatment, new therapeutic approaches are essential. Here, we describe
  a strategy that not only ameliorates symptoms of neuropathic pain but is also potentially
  disease modifying. We show that transplantation of immature telencephalic GABAergic
  interneurons from the mouse medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) into the adult mouse
  spinal cord completely reverses the mechanical hypersensitivity produced by peripheral
  nerve injury. Underlying this improvement is a remarkable integration of the MGE
  transplants into the host spinal cord circuitry, in which the transplanted cells
  make functional connections with both primary afferent and spinal cord neurons.
  By contrast, MGE transplants were not effective against inflammatory pain. Our findings
  suggest that MGE-derived GABAergic interneurons overcome the spinal cord hyperexcitability
  that is a hallmark of nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain.
