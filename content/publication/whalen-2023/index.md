abstract: Using machine learning (ML), we interrogated the function of all human-chimpanzee
  variants in 2,645 human accelerated regions (HARs), finding 43% of HARs have variants
  with large opposing effects on chromatin state and 14% on neurodevelopmental enhancer
  activity. This pattern, consistent with compensatory evolution, was confirmed using
  massively parallel reporter assays in chimpanzee and human neural progenitor cells.
  The species-specific enhancer activity of HARs was accurately predicted from the
  presence and absence of transcription factor footprints in each species. Despite
  these striking cis effects, activity of a given HAR sequence was nearly identical
  in human and chimpanzee cells. This suggests that HARs did not evolve to compensate
  for changes in the trans environment but instead altered their ability to bind factors
  present in both species. Thus, ML prioritized variants with functional effects on
  human neurodevelopment and revealed an unexpected reason why HARs may have evolved
  so rapidly.
