abstract: The human amygdala grows during childhood, and its abnormal development
  is linked to mood disorders. The primate amygdala contains a large population of
  immature neurons in the paralaminar nuclei (PL), suggesting protracted development
  and possibly neurogenesis. Here we studied human PL development from embryonic stages
  to adulthood. The PL develops next to the caudal ganglionic eminence, which generates
  inhibitory interneurons, yet most PL neurons express excitatory markers. In children,
  most PL cells are immature (DCX+PSA-NCAM+), and during adolescence many transition
  into mature (TBR1+VGLUT2+) neurons. Immature PL neurons persist into old age, yet
  local progenitor proliferation sharply decreases in infants. Using single nuclei
  RNA sequencing, we identify the transcriptional profile of immature excitatory neurons
  in the human amygdala between 4-15 years. We conclude that the human PL contains
  excitatory neurons that remain immature for decades, a possible substrate for persistent
  plasticity at the interface of the hippocampus and amygdala.
