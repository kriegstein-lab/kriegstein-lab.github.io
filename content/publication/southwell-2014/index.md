abstract: Many neurologic and psychiatric disorders are marked by imbalances between
  neural excitation and inhibition. In the cerebral cortex, inhibition is mediated
  largely by GABAergic (gamma-aminobutyric acid-secreting) interneurons, a cell type
  that originates in the embryonic ventral telencephalon and populates the cortex
  through long-distance tangential migration. Remarkably, when transplanted from embryos
  or in vitro culture preparations, immature interneurons disperse and integrate into
  host brain circuits, both in the cerebral cortex and in other regions of the central
  nervous system. These features make interneuron transplantation a powerful tool
  for the study of neurodevelopmental processes such as cell specification, cell death,
  and cortical plasticity. Moreover, interneuron transplantation provides a novel
  strategy for modifying neural circuits in rodent models of epilepsy, Parkinson's
  disease, mood disorders, and chronic pain.
