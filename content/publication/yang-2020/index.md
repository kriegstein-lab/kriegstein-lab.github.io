abstract: Accurate RNA quantification at the single-cell level is critical for understanding
  the dynamics of gene expression and regulation across space and time. Single molecule
  FISH (smFISH), such as RNAscope, provides spatial and quantitative measurements
  of individual transcripts, therefore, can be used to explore differential gene expression
  among a heterogeneous cell population if combined with cell identify information.
  However, such analysis is not straightforward, and existing image analysis pipelines
  cannot integrate both RNA transcripts and cellular staining information to automatically
  output cell type-specific gene expression. We developed an efficient and customizable
  analysis method, Single-Molecule Automatic RNA Transcription Quantification (SMART-Q),
  to enable the analysis of gene transcripts in a cell type-specific manner. SMART-Q
  efficiently infers cell identity information from multiplexed immuno-staining and
  quantifies cell type-specific transcripts using a 3D Gaussian fitting algorithm.
  Furthermore, we have optimized SMART-Q for user experiences, such as flexible parameters
  specification, batch data outputs, and visualization of analysis results. SMART-Q
  meets the demands for efficient quantification of single-molecule RNA and can be
  widely used for cell type-specific RNA transcript analysis.
