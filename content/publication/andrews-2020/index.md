abstract: Outer radial glial (oRG) cells are a population of neural stem cells prevalent
  in the developing human cortex that contribute to its cellular diversity and evolutionary
  expansion. The mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway is active
  in human oRG cells. Mutations in mTOR pathway genes are linked to a variety of neurodevelopmental
  disorders and malformations of cortical development. We find that dysregulation
  of mTOR signaling specifically affects oRG cells, but not other progenitor types,
  by changing the actin cytoskeleton through the activity of the Rho-GTPase, CDC42.
  These effects change oRG cellular morphology, migration, and mitotic behavior, but
  do not affect proliferation or cell fate. Thus, mTOR signaling can regulate the
  architecture of the developing human cortex by maintaining the cytoskeletal organization
  of oRG cells and the radial glia scaffold. Our study provides insight into how mTOR
  dysregulation may contribute to neurodevelopmental disease.
