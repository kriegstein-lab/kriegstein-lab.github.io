abstract: We investigated a strategy to ameliorate the motor symptoms of rats that
  received 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesions, a rodent model of Parkinson's disease,
  through transplantation of embryonic medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) cells into
  the striatum. During brain development, embryonic MGE cells migrate into the striatum
  and neocortex where they mature into GABAergic interneurons and play a key role
  in establishing the balance between excitation and inhibition. Unlike most other
  embryonic neurons, MGE cells retain the capacity for migration and integration when
  transplanted into the postnatal and adult brain. We performed MGE cell transplantation
  into the basal ganglia of control and 6-OHDA-lesioned rats. Transplanted MGE cells
  survived, differentiated into GABA(+) neurons, integrated into host circuitry, and
  modified motor behavior in both lesioned and control rats. Our data suggest that
  MGE cell transplantation into the striatum is a promising approach to investigate
  the potential benefits of remodeling basal ganglia circuitry in neurodegenerative
  diseases.
