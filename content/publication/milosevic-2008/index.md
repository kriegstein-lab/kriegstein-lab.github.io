abstract: 'Forebrain subventricular zone (SVZ) progenitor cells give rise to glia
  and olfactory bulb interneurons during early postnatal life in rats. We investigated
  the potential of SVZ cells to alter their fate by transplanting them into a heterotypic
  neurogenic and gliogenic environment-the cerebellum. Transplanted cells were examined
  1 to 7 weeks and 6 months post transplantation. Forebrain progenitors populated
  the cerebellum and differentiated into oligodendrocytes, cerebellar-specific Bergmann
  glia and velate astrocytes, and neurons. The transplanted cells that differentiated
  into neurons maintained an interneuronal fate: they were GABA-positive, expressed
  interneuronal markers, such as calretinin, and exhibited membrane properties that
  are characteristic of interneurons. However, the transplanted interneurons lost
  the expression of the olfactory bulb transcription factors Tbr2 and Dlx1, and acquired
  a cerebellar-like morphology. Forebrain SVZ progenitors thus have the potential
  to adapt to a new environment and integrate into diverse regions, and may be a useful
  tool in transplantation strategies.'
