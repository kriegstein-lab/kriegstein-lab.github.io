abstract: Despite the clinical and genetic heterogeneity of autism, bulk gene expression
  studies show that changes in the neocortex of autism patients converge on common
  genes and pathways. However, direct assessment of specific cell types in the brain
  affected by autism has not been feasible until recently. We used single-nucleus
  RNA sequencing of cortical tissue from patients with autism to identify autism-associated
  transcriptomic changes in specific cell types. We found that synaptic signaling
  of upper-layer excitatory neurons and the molecular state of microglia are preferentially
  affected in autism. Moreover, our results show that dysregulation of specific groups
  of genes in cortico-cortical projection neurons correlates with clinical severity
  of autism. These findings suggest that molecular changes in upper-layer cortical
  circuits are linked to behavioral manifestations of autism.
