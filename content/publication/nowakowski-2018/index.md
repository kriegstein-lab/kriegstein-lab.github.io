abstract: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate many cellular events during brain development
  by interacting with hundreds of mRNA transcripts. However, miRNAs operate nonuniformly
  upon the transcriptional profile with an as yet unknown logic. Shortcomings in defining
  miRNA-mRNA networks include limited knowledge of in vivo miRNA targets and their
  abundance in single cells. By combining multiple complementary approaches, high-throughput
  sequencing of RNA isolated by cross-linking immunoprecipitation with an antibody
  to AGO2 (AGO2-HITS-CLIP), single-cell profiling and computational analyses using
  bipartite and coexpression networks, we show that miRNA-mRNA interactions operate
  as functional modules that often correspond to cell-type identities and undergo
  dynamic transitions during brain development. These networks are highly dynamic
  during development and over the course of evolution. One such interaction is between
  radial-glia-enriched ORC4 and miR-2115, a great-ape-specific miRNA, which appears
  to control radial glia proliferation rates during human brain development.
