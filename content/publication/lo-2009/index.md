abstract: Stem cell researchers commonly use human pluripotent stem cell lines derived
  by other investigators. Researchers may use lines derived elsewhere, provided that
  their derivation met consensus core standards. Some types of derivation raise heightened
  levels of ethical concern and require greater scrutiny. To maintain public trust,
  research institutions need to justify why they allow researchers to use lines whose
  derivation would not have been permitted locally.
