abstract: To understand how diverse progenitor cells contribute to human neocortex
  development, we examined forebrain progenitor behaviour using timelapse imaging.
  Here we find that cell cycle dynamics of human neuroepithelial (NE) cells differ
  from radial glial (RG) cells in both primary tissue and in stem cell-derived organoids.
  NE cells undergoing proliferative, symmetric divisions retract their basal processes,
  and both daughter cells regrow a new process following cytokinesis. The mitotic
  retraction of the basal process is recapitulated by NE cells in cerebral organoids
  generated from human-induced pluripotent stem cells. In contrast, RG cells undergoing
  vertical cleavage retain their basal fibres throughout mitosis, both in primary
  tissue and in older organoids. Our findings highlight developmentally regulated
  changes in mitotic behaviour that may relate to the role of RG cells to provide
  a stable scaffold for neuronal migration, and suggest that the transition in mitotic
  dynamics can be studied in organoid models.
