abstract: Evolutionary expansion of the human neocortex is partially attributed to
  a relative abundance of neural stem cells in the fetal brain called outer radial
  glia (oRG). oRG cells display a characteristic division mode, mitotic somal translocation
  (MST), in which the soma rapidly translocates toward the cortical plate immediately
  prior to cytokinesis. MST may be essential for progenitor zone expansion, but the
  mechanism of MST is unknown, hindering exploration of its function in development
  and disease. Here, we show that MST requires activation of the Rho effector ROCK
  and nonmuscle myosin II, but not intact microtubules, centrosomal translocation
  into the leading process, or calcium influx. MST is independent of mitosis and distinct
  from interkinetic nuclear migration and saltatory migration. Our findings suggest
  that disrupted MST may underlie neurodevelopmental diseases affecting the Rho-ROCK-myosin
  pathway and provide a foundation for future exploration of the role of MST in neocortical
  development, evolution, and disease.
