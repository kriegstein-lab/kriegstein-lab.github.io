abstract: Proper lamination of the cerebral cortex is precisely orchestrated, especially
  when neurons migrate from their place of birth to their final destination. The consequences
  of failure or delay in neuronal migration cause a wide range of disorders, such
  as lissencephaly, schizophrenia, autism and mental retardation. Neuronal migration
  is a dynamic process, which requires dynamic remodeling of the cytoskeleton. In
  this context microtubules and microtubule-related proteins have been suggested to
  play important roles in the regulation of neuronal migration. Here, we will review
  the dynamic aspects of neuronal migration and brain development, describe the molecular
  and cellular mechanisms of neuronal migration and elaborate on neuronal migration
  diseases.
