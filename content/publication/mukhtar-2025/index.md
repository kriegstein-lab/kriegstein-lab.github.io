abstract: Prenatal nicotine exposure impairs fetal cortical grey matter volume, but
  the precise cellular mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study elucidates
  the role of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in progenitor cells and radial
  glia (RG) during human cortical development. We identify two nAChR subunits-CHRNA7
  and the human-specific CHRFAM7A-expressed in SOX2+ progenitors and neurons, with
  CHRFAM7A particularly enriched along RG endfeet. nAChR activation in organotypic
  slices and dissociated cultures increases RG proliferation while decreasing neuronal
  differentiation, whereas nAChR knockdown reduces RG and increases neurons. Single-cell
  RNA sequencing reveals that nicotine exposure downregulates key genes in excitatory
  neurons (ENs), with CHRNA7 or CHRFAM7A selectively modulating these changes, suggesting
  an evolutionary divergence in regulatory pathways. Furthermore, we identify YAP1
  as a critical downstream effector of nAChR signaling, and inhibiting YAP1 reverses
  nicotine-induced phenotypic alterations in oRG cells, highlighting its role in nicotine-induced
  neurodevelopmental pathophysiology.
