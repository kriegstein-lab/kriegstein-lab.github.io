abstract: Synaptic refinement is a critical physiological process that removes excess
  synapses to establish and maintain functional neuronal circuits. Recent studies
  have shown that focal exposure of phosphatidylserine (PS) on synapses acts as an
  \"eat me\" signal to mediate synaptic pruning. However, the molecular mechanism
  underlying PS externalization at synapses remains elusive. Here, we find that murine
  CDC50A, a chaperone of phospholipid flippases, localizes to synapses, and that its
  expression depends on neuronal activity. Cdc50a knockdown leads to phosphatidylserine
  exposure at synapses and subsequent erroneous synapse removal by microglia partly
  via the GPR56 pathway. Taken together, our data support that CDC50A safeguards synapse
  maintenance by regulating focal phosphatidylserine exposure at synapses.
